// C++ uses streams as an interface 
// between the program and input and output devices

// Independent of the actual device 
// Sequence of bytes
// Input streanm provides data to the program
// Output stream receives data from the program
// Input device -> Input stream -> Program -> Output stream -> Output device


// Header files: <iostream> <fstream> <iomanip>
// <iostream> Provides definitions for formatted input and output from/to streams
// <fstream> Provides definitions for formatted input and output from/to file streams
// <iomanip> Provides definitions for manipulators used to format stream I/O


// Class: ios, ifstream, ofstream, fstream, stringstream
// ios - Provides basic support for formatted and unformatted I/O operations. Base class most other classes.
// ifstream - Provides for high-level input operations on file based streams
// ofstream - Provides for high-level output operations on file based streams
// fstream - Provides for high-level I/O operations on file based streams. Derived from ofstream and ifstream
// stringstream - Provides for high-level I/O operations on memory based strings. Derived from istringstream and ostringstream
