13        The Tragedie of Hamlet

14        by William Shakespeare

15        July, 2000  [Etext #2265]


16        ***The Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's First Folio***
17        *********************The Tragedie of Hamlet*********************

18        *****This file should be named 0ws2610.txt or 0ws2610.zip******

19        Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ws2611.txt
20        VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ws2610a.txt


21        Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
22        all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
23        copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
24        of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


25        We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
26        of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

27        Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
28        midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
29        The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
30        Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
31        preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
32        and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
33        up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
34        in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
35        a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
36        look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
37        new copy has at least one byte more or less.


38        Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

39        We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
40        time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
41        to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
42        searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
43        projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
44        per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
45        million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
46        files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
47        If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
48        total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

49        The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
50        Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
51        This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
52        which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

53        At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
54        of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
55        manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
56        from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
57        assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
58        more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
59        don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

60        We need your donations more than ever!

101       Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
102       They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
103       your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
104       someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
105       fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
106       disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
107       you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

108       *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
109       By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
110       etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
111       this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
112       a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
113       sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
114       you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
115       medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

116       ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
117       This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
118       tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
119       Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
120       Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
121       things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
122       on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
123       distribute it in the United States without permission and
124       without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
125       below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
126       under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

127       To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
128       efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
129       works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
130       medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
131       things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
132       corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
133       intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
134       disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
135       codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

136       LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
137       But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
138       [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
139       etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
140       liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
141       legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
142       UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
143       INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
144       OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
145       POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

146       If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
147       receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
148       you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
149       time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
150       on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
151       such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
152       copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
153       choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
154       receive it electronically.

155       THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
156       WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
157       TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
158       LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
159       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

160       Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
161       the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
162       above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
163       may have other legal rights.

164       INDEMNITY
165       You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
166       officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
167       and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or

195                 OR

196            [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at

217       Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie of Hamlet




218       Executive Director's Notes:

219       In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
220       the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
221       been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
222       are presented herein:

223         Barnardo. Who's there?
224         Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
225       your selfe

226          Bar. Long liue the King

227       ***

228       As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
229       or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
230       original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
231       to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
232       that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
233       above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
234       Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .

235       The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
236       time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
237       place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
238       as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
239       more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.

240       You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
241       have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
242       extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
243       very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
244       assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
245       in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
246       purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
247       . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
248       that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
249       variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
250       for signing his name with several different spellings.

251       So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
252       made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
253       that are "not" errors. . . .

254       So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
255       here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie 
256       of Hamlet.

261       Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
262       a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can 
263       come in ASCII to the printed text.

264       The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
265       conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
266       punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
267       printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
268       together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
269       Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
270       spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
271       abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
272       brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
273       you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
274       purer Shakespeare.

275       Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
276       differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
277       be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
278       this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
279       habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
280       then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
281       continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
282       incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
283       The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
284       First Folio editions' best pages.

285       If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
286       errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
287       free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
288       etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
289       and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.

330          Bar. Sit downe a-while,
331       And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
332       That are so fortified against our Story,
333       What we two Nights haue seene

334          Hor. Well, sit we downe,
335       And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this

336          Barn. Last night of all,
337       When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
338       Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
339       Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
340       The Bell then beating one

341          Mar. Peace, breake thee of:
342       Enter the Ghost.

343       Looke where it comes againe

344          Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead

345          Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio

346          Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio

347          Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
348         Barn. It would be spoke too

349          Mar. Question it Horatio

350          Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
351       Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
352       In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
353       Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake

354          Mar. It is offended

355          Barn. See, it stalkes away

356          Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.

357       Exit the Ghost.

358         Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer

359          Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
360       Is not this something more then Fantasie?
361       What thinke you on't?
362         Hor. Before my God, I might not this beleeue
363       Without the sensible and true auouch
364       Of mine owne eyes

365          Mar. Is it not like the King?
366         Hor. As thou art to thy selfe,
367       Such was the very Armour he had on,
368       When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
369       So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
370       He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
371       'Tis strange

372          Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
373       With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch

374          Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:
375       But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
376       This boades some strange erruption to our State

377          Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
378       Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
379       So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
380       And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
381       And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
382       Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
383       Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
384       What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
385       Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
386       Who is't that can informe me?
387         Hor. That can I,
388       At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
389       Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
390       Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
391       (Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
392       Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
393       (For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
394       Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
395       Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
396       Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
397       Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
398       Against the which, a Moity competent
399       Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
400       To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
401       Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
402       And carriage of the Article designe,
403       His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
404       Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
405       Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
406       Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
407       For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
408       That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
409       (And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
410       But to recouer of vs by strong hand
411       And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
412       So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
413       Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
414       The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
415       Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
416       Enter Ghost againe.

417       But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
418       Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
419       If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
420       Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
421       That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
422       If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
423       (Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
424       Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
425       Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
426       (For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
427       Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus

428          Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
429         Hor. Do, if it will not stand

430          Barn. 'Tis heere

431          Hor. 'Tis heere

432          Mar. 'Tis gone.

433       Exit Ghost.

434       We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
435       To offer it the shew of Violence,
436       For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
437       And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery

438          Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew

439          Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
440       Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
441       The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
442       Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
443       Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
444       Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
445       Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
446       To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
447       This present Obiect made probation

448          Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
449       Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
450       Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
451       The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
452       And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
453       The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
454       No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
455       So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time

456          Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
457       But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
458       Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
459       Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
460       Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
461       Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
462       This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
463       Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
464       As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
465         Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
466       Where we shall finde him most conueniently.

467       Exeunt.

468       Scena Secunda.

469       Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,
470       Polonius,
471       Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.

472         King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death
473       The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
474       To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
475       To be contracted in one brow of woe:
476       Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
477       That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
478       Together with remembrance of our selues.
479       Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
480       Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
481       Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
482       With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
483       With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
484       In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
485       Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
486       Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
487       With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
488       Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,
489       Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
490       Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
491       Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
492       Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
493       He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
494       Importing the surrender of those Lands
495       Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
496       To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
497       Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.

498       Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
499       Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
500       To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,
501       Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
502       Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
503       His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
504       The Lists, and full proportions are all made
505       Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
506       You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,
507       For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
508       Giuing to you no further personall power
509       To businesse with the King, more then the scope
510       Of these dilated Articles allow:
511       Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty

512          Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty

513          King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.

514       Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.

515       And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
516       You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?
517       You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
518       And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
519       That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
520       The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
521       The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,
522       Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
523       What would'st thou haue Laertes?
524         Laer. Dread my Lord,
525       Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
526       From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
527       To shew my duty in your Coronation,
528       Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
529       My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
530       And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon

531          King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?
532       What sayes Pollonius?
533         Pol. He hath my Lord:
534       I do beseech you giue him leaue to go

535          King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,
536       And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
537       But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
538         Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde

539          King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
540         Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun

541          Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,
542       And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
543       Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
544       Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
545       Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
546       Passing through Nature, to Eternity

547          Ham. I Madam, it is common

548          Queen. If it be;
549       Why seemes it so particular with thee

550          Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
551       'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
552       Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
553       Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
554       No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
555       Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
556       Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
557       That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
558       For they are actions that a man might play:
559       But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
560       These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe

561          King. 'Tis sweet and commendable
562       In your Nature Hamlet,
563       To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
564       But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
565       That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
566       In filiall Obligation, for some terme
567       To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
568       In obstinate Condolement, is a course
569       Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
570       It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
571       A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
572       An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
573       For, what we know must be, and is as common
574       As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
575       Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
576       Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
577       A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
578       To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
579       Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
580       From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
581       This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
582       This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
583       As of a Father; For let the world take note,
584       You are the most immediate to our Throne,
585       And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
586       Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
587       Do I impart towards you. For your intent
588       In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
589       It is most retrograde to our desire:
590       And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
591       Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
592       Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne

593          Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
594       I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg

595          Ham. I shall in all my best
596       Obey you Madam

597          King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
598       Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
599       This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
600       Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
601       No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
602       But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
603       And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
604       Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.

605       Exeunt.

606       Manet Hamlet.

607         Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
608       Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
609       Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
610       His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
611       How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
612       Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
613       Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
614       That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
615       Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
616       But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
617       So excellent a King, that was to this
618       Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
619       That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
620       Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
621       Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
622       As if encrease of Appetite had growne
623       By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
624       Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
625       A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
626       With which she followed my poore Fathers body
627       Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.
628       (O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
629       Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
630       My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
631       Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?
632       Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
633       Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
634       She married. O most wicked speed, to post
635       With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
636       It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
637       But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
638       Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.

639         Hor. Haile to your Lordship

640          Ham. I am glad to see you well:
641       Horatio, or I do forget my selfe

642          Hor. The same my Lord,
643       And your poore Seruant euer

644          Ham. Sir my good friend,
645       Ile change that name with you:
646       And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
647       Marcellus

648          Mar. My good Lord

649          Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
650       But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
651         Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord

652          Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;
653       Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
654       To make it truster of your owne report
655       Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
656       But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
657       Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart

658          Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall

659          Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)
660       I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding

661          Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon

662          Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats
663       Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
664       Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
665       Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
666       My father, me thinkes I see my father

667          Hor. Oh where my Lord?
668         Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)
669         Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King

670          Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:
671       I shall not look vpon his like againe

672          Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight

673          Ham. Saw? Who?
674         Hor. My Lord, the King your Father

675          Ham. The King my Father?
676         Hor. Season your admiration for a while
677       With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
678       Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
679       This maruell to you

680          Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare

681          Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
682       (Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch
683       In the dead wast and middle of the night
684       Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
685       Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
686       Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
687       Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
688       By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
689       Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
690       Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
691       Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
692       In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
693       And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
694       Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
695       Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
696       The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
697       These hands are not more like

698          Ham. But where was this?
699         Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht

700          Ham. Did you not speake to it?
701         Hor. My Lord, I did;
702       But answere made it none: yet once me thought
703       It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
704       It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
705       But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
706       And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
707       And vanisht from our sight

708          Ham. Tis very strange

709          Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
710       And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
711       To let you know of it

712          Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
713       Hold you the watch to Night?
714         Both. We doe my Lord

715          Ham. Arm'd, say you?
716         Both. Arm'd, my Lord

717          Ham. From top to toe?
718         Both. My Lord, from head to foote

719          Ham. Then saw you not his face?
720         Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp

721          Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?
722         Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger

723          Ham. Pale, or red?
724         Hor. Nay very pale

725          Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?
726         Hor. Most constantly

727          Ham. I would I had beene there

728          Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you

729          Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?
730         Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred

731          All. Longer, longer

732          Hor. Not when I saw't

733          Ham. His Beard was grisly? no

734          Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
735       A Sable Siluer'd

736          Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe

737          Hor. I warrant you it will

738          Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,
739       Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
740       And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
741       If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
742       Let it bee treble in your silence still:
743       And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
744       Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
745       I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:
746       Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
747       Ile visit you

748          All. Our duty to your Honour.

749       Exeunt

750          Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
751       My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
752       I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
753       Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
754       Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
755       Enter.


756       Scena Tertia


757       Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

758         Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
759       And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
760       And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
761       But let me heare from you

762          Ophel. Doe you doubt that?
763         Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,
764       Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;
765       A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
766       Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
767       The suppliance of a minute? No more

768          Ophel. No more but so

769          Laer. Thinke it no more:
770       For nature cressant does not grow alone,
771       In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
772       The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
773       Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
774       And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
775       The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
776       His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
777       For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
778       Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
779       Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
780       The sanctity and health of the whole State.
781       And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
782       Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
783       Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
784       It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
785       As he in his peculiar Sect and force
786       May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
787       Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
788       Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,
789       If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
790       Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
791       To his vnmastred importunity.
792       Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
793       And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
794       Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
795       The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
796       If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
797       Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
798       The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
799       Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
800       And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
801       Contagious blastments are most imminent.
802       Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
803       Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere

804          Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,
805       As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother
806       Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
807       Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
808       Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
809       Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
810       And reaks not his owne reade

811          Laer. Oh, feare me not.
812       Enter Polonius.

813       I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
814       A double blessing is a double grace;
815       Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue

816          Polon. Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,
817       The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
818       And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
819       And these few Precepts in thy memory,
820       See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
821       Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:
822       Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:
823       The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,
824       Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
825       But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
826       Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
827       Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
828       Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
829       Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
830       Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
831       Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
832       But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
833       For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
834       And they in France of the best ranck and station,
835       Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
836       Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
837       For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
838       And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
839       This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
840       And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
841       Thou canst not then be false to any man.
842       Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee

843          Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord

844          Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend

845          Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
846       What I haue said to you

847          Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,
848       And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it

849          Laer. Farewell.

850       Exit Laer.

851         Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?
852         Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet

853          Polon. Marry, well bethought:
854       Tis told me he hath very oft of late
855       Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
856       Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
857       If it be so, as so tis put on me;
858       And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
859       You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
860       As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
861       What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
862         Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
863       Of his affection to me

864          Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
865       Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
866       Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
867         Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke

868          Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
869       That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
870       Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
871       Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
872       Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole

873          Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
874       In honourable fashion

875          Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too

876          Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
877       My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen

878          Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
879       When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
880       Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
881       Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
882       Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
883       You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
884       Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
885       Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
886       Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
887       Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
888       And with a larger tether may he walke,
889       Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,
890       Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
891       Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
892       But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
893       Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
894       The better to beguile. This is for all:
895       I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
896       Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
897       As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
898       Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes

899          Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.

900       Exeunt.

901       Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.

902         Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
903         Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre

904          Ham. What hower now?
905         Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue

906          Mar. No, it is strooke

907          Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
908       Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
909       What does this meane my Lord?
910         Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,
911       Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
912       And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
913       The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
914       The triumph of his Pledge

915          Horat. Is it a custome?
916         Ham. I marry ist;
917       And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
918       And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
919       More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
920       Enter Ghost.

921         Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes

922          Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
923       Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
924       Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,
925       Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
926       Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
927       That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,
928       King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
929       Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
930       Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
931       Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
932       Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
933       Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
934       To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
935       That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
936       Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
937       Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
938       So horridly to shake our disposition,
939       With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
940       Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?

941       Ghost beckens Hamlet.

942         Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,
943       As if it some impartment did desire
944       To you alone

945          Mar. Looke with what courteous action
946       It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
947       But doe not goe with it

948          Hor. No, by no meanes

949          Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it

950          Hor. Doe not my Lord

951          Ham. Why, what should be the feare?
952       I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
953       And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
954       Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
955       It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it

956          Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
957       Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
958       That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
959       And there assumes some other horrible forme,
960       Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
961       And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
962         Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee

963          Mar. You shall not goe my Lord

964          Ham. Hold off your hand

965          Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe

966          Ham. My fate cries out,
967       And makes each petty Artire in this body,
968       As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
969       Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
970       By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
971       I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.

972       Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.

973         Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination

974          Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him

975          Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?
976         Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke

977          Hor. Heauen will direct it

978          Mar. Nay, let's follow him.

979       Exeunt.

980       Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

981         Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further

982          Gho. Marke me

983          Ham. I will

984          Gho. My hower is almost come,
985       When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
986       Must render vp my selfe

987          Ham. Alas poore Ghost

988          Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
989       To what I shall vnfold

990          Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare

991          Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare

992          Ham. What?
993         Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,
994       Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
995       And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
996       Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
997       Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
998       To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;
999       I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
1000      Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
1001      Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
1002      Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
1003      And each particular haire to stand an end,
1004      Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
1005      But this eternall blason must not be
1006      To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,
1007      If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue

1008         Ham. Oh Heauen!
1009        Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther

1010         Ham. Murther?
1011        Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
1012      But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall

1013         Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,
1014      That with wings as swift
1015      As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
1016      May sweepe to my Reuenge

1017         Ghost. I finde thee apt,
1018      And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
1019      That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
1020      Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:
1021      It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
1022      A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
1023      Is by a forged processe of my death
1024      Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
1025      The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
1026      Now weares his Crowne

1027         Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
1028        Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
1029      With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
1030      Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
1031      So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust
1032      The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
1033      Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
1034      From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
1035      That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
1036      I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
1037      Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
1038      To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
1039      Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
1040      So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
1041      Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
1042      But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
1043      Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
1044      My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
1045      Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
1046      With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
1047      And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
1048      The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
1049      Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
1050      That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
1051      The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;
1052      And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
1053      And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
1054      The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
1055      And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
1056      Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
1057      All my smooth Body.
1058      Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
1059      Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
1060      Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
1061      Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
1062      No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1063      With all my imperfections on my head;
1064      Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
1065      If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
1066      Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
1067      A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
1068      But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
1069      Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
1070      Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
1071      And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
1072      To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
1073      The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
1074      And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
1075      Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
1076      Enter.

1077        Ham. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
1078      And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
1079      And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
1080      But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
1081      I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
1082      In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
1083      Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
1084      Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
1085      All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
1086      That youth and obseruation coppied there;
1087      And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
1088      Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
1089      Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:
1090      Oh most pernicious woman!
1091      Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
1092      My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
1093      That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
1094      At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
1095      So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
1096      It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't

1097         Hor. & Mar. within. My Lord, my Lord.
1098      Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

1099        Mar. Lord Hamlet

1100         Hor. Heauen secure him

1101         Mar. So be it

1102         Hor. Illo, ho, ho, my Lord

1103         Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come

1104         Mar. How ist my Noble Lord?
1105        Hor. What newes, my Lord?
1106        Ham. Oh wonderfull!
1107        Hor. Good my Lord tell it

1108         Ham. No you'l reueale it

1109         Hor. Not I, my Lord, by Heauen

1110         Mar. Nor I, my Lord

1111         Ham. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
1112      But you'l be secret?
1113        Both. I, by Heau'n, my Lord

1114         Ham. There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
1115      But hee's an arrant knaue

1116         Hor. There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
1117      Graue, to tell vs this

1118         Ham. Why right, you are i'th' right;
1119      And so, without more circumstance at all,
1120      I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
1121      You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
1122      For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
1123      Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
1124      Looke you, Ile goe pray

1125         Hor. These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord

1126         Ham. I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
1127      Yes faith, heartily

1128         Hor. There's no offence my Lord

1129         Ham. Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,
1130      And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
1131      It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
1132      For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
1133      O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,
1134      As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
1135      Giue me one poore request

1136         Hor. What is't my Lord? we will

1137         Ham. Neuer make known what you haue seen to night

1138         Both. My Lord, we will not

1139         Ham. Nay, but swear't

1140         Hor. Infaith my Lord, not I

1141         Mar. Nor I my Lord: in faith

1142         Ham. Vpon my sword

1143         Marcell. We haue sworne my Lord already

1144         Ham. Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed

1145         Gho. Sweare.

1146      Ghost cries vnder the Stage.

1147        Ham. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny?
1148      Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
1149      Consent to sweare

1150         Hor. Propose the Oath my Lord

1151         Ham. Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
1152      Sweare by my sword

1153         Gho. Sweare

1154         Ham. Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
1155      Come hither Gentlemen,
1156      And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
1157      Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:
1158      Sweare by my Sword

1159         Gho. Sweare

1160         Ham. Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
1161      A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends

1162         Hor. Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange

1163         Ham. And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
1164      There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,
1165      Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,
1166      Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
1167      How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
1168      (As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
1169      To put an Anticke disposition on:)
1170      That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
1171      With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
1172      Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
1173      As well, we know, or we could and if we would,
1174      Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
1175      Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
1176      That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
1177      So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:
1178      Sweare

1179         Ghost. Sweare

1180         Ham. Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
1181      With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
1182      And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
1183      May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
1184      God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
1185      And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
1186      The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
1187      That euer I was borne to set it right.
1188      Nay, come let's goe together.

1189      Exeunt.


1190      Actus Secundus.

1191      Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo.

1192        Polon. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo

1193         Reynol. I will my Lord

1194         Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,
1195      Before you visite him you make inquiry
1196      Of his behauiour

1197         Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it

1198         Polon. Marry, well said;
1199      Very well said. Looke you Sir,
1200      Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
1201      And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
1202      What company, at what expence: and finding
1203      By this encompassement and drift of question,
1204      That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
1205      Then your particular demands will touch it,
1206      Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
1207      And thus I know his father and his friends,
1208      And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
1209        Reynol. I, very well my Lord

1210         Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;
1211      But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
1212      Addicted so and so; and there put on him
1213      What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,
1214      As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
1215      But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
1216      As are Companions noted and most knowne
1217      To youth and liberty

1218         Reynol. As gaming my Lord

1219         Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
1220      Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre

1221         Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him

1222         Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
1223      You must not put another scandall on him,
1224      That hee is open to Incontinencie;
1225      That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
1226      That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
1227      The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
1228      A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault

1229         Reynol. But my good Lord

1230         Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?
1231        Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that

1232         Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
1233      And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
1234      You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
1235      As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
1236      Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,
1237      Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
1238      The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
1239      He closes with you in this consequence:
1240      Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
1241      According to the Phrase and the Addition,
1242      Of man and Country

1243         Reynol. Very good my Lord

1244         Polon. And then Sir does he this?
1245      He does: what was I about to say?
1246      I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
1247        Reynol. At closes in the consequence:
1248      At friend, or so, and Gentleman

1249         Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,
1250      He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
1251      I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
1252      Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
1253      There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
1254      There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
1255      I saw him enter such a house of saile;
1256      Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;
1257      Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
1258      And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
1259      With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
1260      By indirections finde directions out:
1261      So by my former Lecture and aduice
1262      Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
1263        Reynol. My Lord I haue

1264         Polon. God buy you; fare you well

1265         Reynol. Good my Lord

1266         Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe

1267         Reynol. I shall my Lord

1268         Polon. And let him plye his Musicke

1269         Reynol. Well, my Lord.
1270      Enter.

1271      Enter Ophelia.

1272        Polon. Farewell:
1273      How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
1274        Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted

1275         Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?
1276        Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
1277      Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
1278      No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
1279      Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
1280      Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
1281      And with a looke so pitious in purport,
1282      As if he had been loosed out of hell,
1283      To speake of horrors: he comes before me

1284         Polon. Mad for thy Loue?
1285        Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it

1286         Polon. What said he?
1287        Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
1288      Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
1289      And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
1290      He fals to such perusall of my face,
1291      As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
1292      At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
1293      And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
1294      He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
1295      That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
1296      And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
1297      And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
1298      He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
1299      For out adores he went without their helpe;
1300      And to the last, bended their light on me

1301         Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
1302      This is the very extasie of Loue,
1303      Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
1304      And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
1305      As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
1306      That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
1307      What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
1308        Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,
1309      I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
1310      His accesse to me

1311         Pol. That hath made him mad.
1312      I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
1313      I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
1314      And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
1315      It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
1316      To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
1317      As it is common for the yonger sort
1318      To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
1319      This must be knowne, being kept close might moue
1320      More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.

1321      Exeunt.


1322      Scena Secunda.

1323      Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.

1324        King. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
1325      Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
1326      The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
1327      Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard
1328      Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
1329      Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
1330      Resembles that it was. What it should bee
1331      More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
1332      So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
1333      I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
1334      That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
1335      And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
1336      That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
1337      Some little time: so by your Companies
1338      To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
1339      So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
1340      That open'd lies within our remedie

1341         Qu. Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1342      And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
1343      To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1344      To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,
1345      As to expend your time with vs a-while,
1346      For the supply and profit of our Hope,
1347      Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
1348      As fits a Kings remembrance

1349         Rosin. Both your Maiesties
1350      Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
1351      Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
1352      Then to Entreatie

1353         Guil. We both obey,
1354      And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
1355      To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
1356      To be commanded

1357         King. Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne

1358         Qu. Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
1359      And I beseech you instantly to visit
1360      My too much changed Sonne.
1361      Go some of ye,
1362      And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is

1363         Guil. Heauens make our presence and our practises
1364      Pleasant and helpfull to him.
1365      Enter.

1366        Queene. Amen.
1367      Enter Polonius.

1368        Pol. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
1369      Are ioyfully return'd

1370         King. Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes

1371         Pol. Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,
1372      I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
1373      Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
1374      And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
1375      Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
1376      As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
1377      The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie

1378         King. Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare

1379         Pol. Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
1380      My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast

1381         King. Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
1382      He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
1383      The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper

1384         Qu. I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
1385      His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.
1386      Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.

1387        King. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:
1388      Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?
1389        Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
1390      Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
1391      His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
1392      To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
1393      But better look'd into, he truly found
1394      It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
1395      That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
1396      Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
1397      On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
1398      Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
1399      Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
1400      To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
1401      Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
1402      Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
1403      And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
1404      So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
1405      With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
1406      That it might please you to giue quiet passe
1407      Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
1408      On such regards of safety and allowance,
1409      As therein are set downe

1410         King. It likes vs well:
1411      And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
1412      Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
1413      Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
1414      Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
1415      Most welcome home.

1416      Exit Ambass.

1417        Pol. This businesse is very well ended.
1418      My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
1419      What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
1420      Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
1421      Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
1422      Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
1423      And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
1424      I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
1425      Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
1426      What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
1427      But let that go

1428         Qu. More matter, with lesse Art

1429         Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
1430      That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
1431      And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
1432      But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
1433      Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
1434      That we finde out the cause of this effect,
1435      Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
1436      For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
1437      Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
1438      I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
1439      Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
1440      Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.

1441      The Letter.

1442      To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.
1443      That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
1444      Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white
1445      bosome, these

1446         Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her

1447         Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
1448      Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
1449      Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
1450      Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
1451      But neuer Doubt, I loue.
1452      O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to
1453      reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue
1454      it. Adieu.
1455      Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
1456      Machine is to him, Hamlet.
1457      This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
1458      And more aboue hath his soliciting,
1459      As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
1460      All giuen to mine eare

1461         King. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
1462        Pol. What do you thinke of me?
1463        King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable

1464         Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?
1465      When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
1466      As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
1467      Before my Daughter told me what might you
1468      Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
1469      If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
1470      Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
1471      Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
1472      What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
1473      And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
1474      Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,
1475      This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
1476      That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
1477      Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
1478      Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
1479      And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
1480      Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
1481      Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
1482      Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
1483      Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
1484      And all we waile for

1485         King. Do you thinke 'tis this?
1486        Qu. It may be very likely

1487         Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
1488      That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
1489      When it prou'd otherwise?
1490        King. Not that I know

1491         Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
1492      If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
1493      Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
1494      Within the Center

1495         King. How may we try it further?
1496        Pol. You know sometimes
1497      He walkes foure houres together, heere
1498      In the Lobby

1499         Qu. So he ha's indeed

1500         Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
1501      Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
1502      Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
1503      And be not from his reason falne thereon;
1504      Let me be no Assistant for a State,
1505      And keepe a Farme and Carters

1506         King. We will try it.
1507      Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.

1508        Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretch
1509      Comes reading

1510         Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,
1511      Ile boord him presently.

1512      Exit King & Queen.

1513      Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?
1514        Ham. Well, God-a-mercy

1515         Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?
1516        Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger

1517         Pol. Not I my Lord

1518         Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man

1519         Pol. Honest, my Lord?
1520        Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
1521      one man pick'd out of two thousand

1522         Pol. That's very true, my Lord

1523         Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
1524      being a good kissing Carrion-
1525      Haue you a daughter?
1526        Pol. I haue my Lord

1527         Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a
1528      blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend
1529      looke too't

1530         Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:
1531      yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
1532      he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
1533      I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
1534      speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?
1535        Ham. Words, words, words

1536         Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?
1537        Ham. Betweene who?
1538        Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord

1539         Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
1540      that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
1541      their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
1542      Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
1543      together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I
1544      most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
1545      not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
1546      selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
1547      go backward

1548         Pol. Though this be madnesse,
1549      Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
1550      Out of the ayre my Lord?
1551        Ham. Into my Graue?
1552        Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:
1553      How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
1554      A happinesse,
1555      That often Madnesse hits on,
1556      Which Reason and Sanitie could not
1557      So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
1558      I will leaue him,
1559      And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
1560      Betweene him, and my daughter.
1561      My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly
1562      Take my leaue of you

1563         Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
1564      will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
1565      life

1566         Polon. Fare you well my Lord

1567         Ham. These tedious old fooles

1568         Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there
1569      hee is.
1570      Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.

1571        Rosin. God saue you Sir

1572         Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?
1573        Rosin. My most deare Lord?
1574        Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou
1575      Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye
1576      both?
1577        Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth

1578         Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes
1579      Cap, we are not the very Button

1580         Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
1581        Rosin. Neither my Lord

1582         Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle
1583      of her fauour?
1584        Guil. Faith, her priuates, we

1585         Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:
1586      she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?
1587        Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne
1588      honest

1589         Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is
1590      not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue
1591      you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
1592      that she sends you to Prison hither?
1593        Guil. Prison, my Lord?
1594        Ham. Denmark's a Prison

1595         Rosin. Then is the World one

1596         Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
1597      Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
1598      worst

1599         Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord

1600         Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
1601      either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
1602      a prison

1603         Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
1604      too narrow for your minde

1605         Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
1606      count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
1607      I haue bad dreames

1608         Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
1609      very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
1610      of a Dreame

1611         Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow

1612         Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
1613      light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow

1614         Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs
1615      and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
1616      shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
1617        Both. Wee'l wait vpon you

1618         Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the
1619      rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
1620      man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
1621      way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?
1622        Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion

1623         Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
1624      but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
1625      are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it
1626      your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
1627      deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake

1628         Guil. What should we say my Lord?
1629        Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were
1630      sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
1631      which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
1632      I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you

1633         Rosin. To what end my Lord?
1634        Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
1635      you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
1636      our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,
1637      and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
1638      you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
1639      were sent for or no

1640         Rosin. What say you?
1641        Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me
1642      hold not off

1643         Guil. My Lord, we were sent for

1644         Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
1645      preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
1646      Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
1647      I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
1648      and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;
1649      that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
1650      Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
1651      look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
1652      fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
1653      to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.
1654      What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in
1655      Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing
1656      how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?
1657      in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the
1658      world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
1659      this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,
1660      nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
1661      to say so

1662         Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
1663      thoughts

1664         Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
1665      not me?
1666        Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
1667      what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
1668      from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
1669      they comming to offer you Seruice

1670         Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
1671      Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
1672      Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
1673      not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
1674      peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
1675      are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
1676      freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
1677      are they?
1678        Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in
1679      the Tragedians of the City

1680         Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence
1681      both in reputation and profit was better both
1682      wayes

1683         Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
1684      of the late Innouation?
1685        Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did
1686      when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?
1687        Rosin. No indeed, they are not

1688         Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?
1689        Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
1690      pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
1691      Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
1692      are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
1693      fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
1694      call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
1695      Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither

1696         Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?
1697      How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no
1698      longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
1699      if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
1700      it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
1701      do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
1702      owne Succession

1703         Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
1704      and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.
1705      There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,
1706      vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
1707      the Question

1708         Ham. Is't possible?
1709        Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of
1710      Braines

1711         Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?
1712        Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too

1713         Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
1714      Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
1715      while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
1716      Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something
1717      in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
1718      finde it out.

1719      Flourish for the Players.

1720        Guil. There are the Players

1721         Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
1722      hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
1723      and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
1724      lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
1725      fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
1726      then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
1727      and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd

1728         Guil. In what my deere Lord?
1729        Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the
1730      Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
1731      Enter Polonius.

1732        Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen

1733         Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
1734      eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
1735      out of his swathing clouts

1736         Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for
1737      they say, an old man is twice a childe

1738         Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the
1739      Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
1740      'twas so indeed

1741         Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you

1742         Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
1743      When Rossius an Actor in Rome-
1744        Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord

1745         Ham. Buzze, buzze

1746         Pol. Vpon mine Honor

1747         Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-
1748        Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
1749      Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
1750      Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
1751      Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
1752      Scene indiuidible: or Poem
1753      vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus
1754      too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are
1755      the onely men

1756         Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st
1757      thou?
1758        Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
1759        Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,
1760      The which he loued passing well

1761         Pol. Still on my Daughter

1762         Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
1763        Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter
1764      that I loue passing well

1765         Ham. Nay that followes not

1766         Polon. What followes then, my Lord?
1767        Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It
1768      came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
1769      Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my
1770      Abridgements come.
1771      Enter foure or fiue Players.

1772      Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see
1773      thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?
1774      Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
1775      beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
1776      Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
1777      I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
1778      your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
1779      within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
1780      to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
1781      haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:
1782      come, a passionate speech

1783         1.Play. What speech, my Lord?
1784        Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
1785      neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
1786      remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
1787      Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
1788      iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
1789      excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
1790      with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,
1791      there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;
1792      nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
1793      Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One
1794      cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
1795      to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
1796      of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at
1797      this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like
1798      th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
1799      The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
1800      Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
1801      When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
1802      Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
1803      With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
1804      Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
1805      With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
1806      Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
1807      That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
1808      To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
1809      And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
1810      With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
1811      Olde Grandsire Priam seekes

1812         Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,
1813      and good discretion

1814         1.Player. Anon he findes him,
1815      Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,
1816      Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
1817      Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
1818      Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:
1819      But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
1820      Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,
1821      Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
1822      Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
1823      Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword
1824      Which was declining on the Milkie head
1825      Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
1826      So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
1827      And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
1828      But as we often see against some storme,
1829      A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
1830      The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
1831      As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
1832      Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,
1833      A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
1834      And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
1835      On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
1836      With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword
1837      Now falles on Priam.
1838      Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,
1839      In generall Synod take away her power:
1840      Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
1841      And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
1842      As low as to the Fiends

1843         Pol. This is too long

1844         Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee
1845      say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
1846      sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba

1847         1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen

1848         Ham. The inobled Queene?
1849        Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good

1850         1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,
1851      Threatning the flame
1852      With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
1853      Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
1854      About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
1855      A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
1856      Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
1857      'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
1858      But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
1859      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
1860      In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
1861      The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
1862      (Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)
1863      Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
1864      And passion in the Gods

1865         Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and
1866      ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more

1867         Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
1868      soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.
1869      Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
1870      the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After
1871      your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
1872      their ill report while you liued

1873         Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart

1874         Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man
1875      after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
1876      them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they
1877      deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them
1878      in

1879         Pol. Come sirs.

1880      Exit Polon.

1881        Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
1882      Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the
1883      murther of Gonzago?
1884        Play. I my Lord

1885         Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a
1886      need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
1887      I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?
1888        Play. I my Lord

1889         Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you
1890      mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night
1891      you are welcome to Elsonower?
1892        Rosin. Good my Lord.

1893      Exeunt.

1894      Manet Hamlet.

1895        Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
1896      Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
1897      Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
1898      But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
1899      Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
1900      That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
1901      Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
1902      A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
1903      With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?
1904      For Hecuba?
1905      What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
1906      That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,
1907      Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
1908      That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,
1909      And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
1910      Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
1911      Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
1912      The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
1913      A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake
1914      Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
1915      And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
1916      Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
1917      A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?
1918      Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?
1919      Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
1920      Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,
1921      As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
1922      Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
1923      But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
1924      To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
1925      I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
1926      With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,
1927      Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
1928      Oh Vengeance!
1929      Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,
1930      That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,
1931      Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,
1932      Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
1933      And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
1934      A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.
1935      I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
1936      Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,
1937      Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently
1938      They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
1939      For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake
1940      With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,
1941      Play something like the murder of my Father,
1942      Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,
1943      Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench
1944      I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
1945      May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power
1946      T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
1947      Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
1948      As he is very potent with such Spirits,
1949      Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds
1950      More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,
1951      Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.

1952      Exit

1953      Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
1954      Guildenstern, and
1955      Lords.

1956        King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
1957      Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
1958      Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
1959      With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy

1960         Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
1961      But from what cause he will by no meanes speake

1962         Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
1963      But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
1964      When we would bring him on to some Confession
1965      Of his true state

1966         Qu. Did he receiue you well?
1967        Rosin. Most like a Gentleman

1968         Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition

1969         Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands
1970      Most free in his reply

1971         Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?
1972        Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
1973      We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,
1974      And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
1975      To heare of it: They are about the Court,
1976      And (as I thinke) they haue already order
1977      This night to play before him

1978         Pol. 'Tis most true:
1979      And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
1980      To heare, and see the matter

1981         King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
1982      To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,
1983      Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on
1984      To these delights

1985         Rosin. We shall my Lord.

1986      Exeunt.

1987        King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,
1988      For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,
1989      That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
1990      Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)
1991      Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
1992      We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
1993      And gather by him, as he is behaued,
1994      If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
1995      That thus he suffers for

1996         Qu. I shall obey you,
1997      And for your part Ophelia, I do wish
1998      That your good Beauties be the happy cause
1999      Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
2000      Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
2001      To both your Honors

2002         Ophe. Madam, I wish it may

2003         Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
2004      We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
2005      That shew of such an exercise may colour
2006      Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,
2007      'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
2008      And pious Action, we do surge o're
2009      The diuell himselfe

2010         King. Oh 'tis true:
2011      How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
2012      The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art
2013      Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
2014      Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
2015      Oh heauie burthen!
2016        Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.

2017      Exeunt.

2018      Enter Hamlet.

2019        Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
2020      Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
2021      The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
2022      Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
2023      And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
2024      No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
2025      The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
2026      That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
2027      Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
2028      To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,
2029      For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
2030      When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,
2031      Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
2032      That makes Calamity of so long life:
2033      For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
2034      The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
2035      The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
2036      The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
2037      That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
2038      When he himselfe might his Quietus make
2039      With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
2040      To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
2041      But that the dread of something after death,
2042      The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
2043      No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
2044      And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
2045      Then flye to others that we know not of.
2046      Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
2047      And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
2048      Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
2049      And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
2050      With this regard their Currants turne away,
2051      And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
2052      The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons
2053      Be all my sinnes remembred

2054         Ophe. Good my Lord,
2055      How does your Honor for this many a day?
2056        Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well

2057         Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
2058      That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
2059      I pray you now, receiue them

2060         Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought

2061         Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
2062      And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
2063      As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
2064      Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
2065      Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
2066      There my Lord

2067         Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?
2068        Ophe. My Lord

2069         Ham. Are you faire?
2070        Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?
2071        Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
2072      should admit no discourse to your Beautie

2073         Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
2074      then your Honestie?
2075        Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
2076      transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
2077      force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
2078      This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
2079      proofe. I did loue you once

2080         Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so

2081         Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
2082      cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
2083      of it. I loued you not

2084         Ophe. I was the more deceiued

2085         Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou
2086      be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
2087      but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
2088      my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,
2089      Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
2090      then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
2091      them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such
2092      Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
2093      We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
2094      wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?
2095        Ophe. At home, my Lord

2096         Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
2097      play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell

2098         Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens

2099         Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
2100      for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
2101      thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
2102      Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
2103      for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
2104      make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell

2105         Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him

2106         Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
2107      God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:
2108      you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
2109      Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.
2110      Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
2111      I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
2112      married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
2113      as they are. To a Nunnery, go.

2114      Exit Hamlet.

2115        Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
2116      The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
2117      Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
2118      The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
2119      Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
2120      Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
2121      That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
2122      Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
2123      Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
2124      That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
2125      Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
2126      T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
2127      Enter King, and Polonius.

2128        King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
2129      Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
2130      Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
2131      O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
2132      And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
2133      Will be some danger, which to preuent
2134      I haue in quicke determination
2135      Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
2136      For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
2137      Haply the Seas and Countries different
2138      With variable Obiects, shall expell
2139      This something setled matter in his heart:
2140      Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
2141      From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?
2142        Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
2143      The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
2144      Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?
2145      You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
2146      We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
2147      But if you hold it fit after the Play,
2148      Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
2149      To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
2150      And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
2151      Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
2152      To England send him: Or confine him where
2153      Your wisedome best shall thinke

2154         King. It shall be so:
2155      Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.

2156      Exeunt.

2157      Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.

2158        Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
2159      it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
2160      as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
2161      had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
2162      your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
2163      Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
2164      Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
2165      may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,
2166      to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
2167      to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
2168      Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
2169      nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
2170      haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
2171      outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it

2172         Player. I warrant your Honor

2173         Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
2174      Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,
2175      the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
2176      That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
2177      thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
2178      end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
2179      the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
2180      Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
2181      Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this
2182      ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull
2183      laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
2184      censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway
2185      a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players
2186      that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
2187      highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
2188      the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
2189      or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
2190      thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,
2191      and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably

2192         Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
2193      vs, Sir

2194         Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that
2195      play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
2196      them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
2197      to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
2198      too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
2199      of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
2200      shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
2201      it. Go make you readie.

2202      Exit Players.

2203      Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.

2204      How now my Lord,
2205      Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
2206        Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently

2207         Ham. Bid the Players make hast.

2208      Exit Polonius.

2209      Will you two helpe to hasten them?
2210        Both. We will my Lord.

2211      Exeunt.

2212      Enter Horatio.

2213        Ham. What hoa, Horatio?
2214        Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice

2215         Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man
2216      As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall

2217         Hora. O my deere Lord

2218         Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
2219      For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
2220      That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
2221      To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
2222      No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
2223      And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
2224      Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
2225      Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
2226      And could of men distinguish, her election
2227      Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
2228      As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
2229      A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
2230      Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
2231      Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,
2232      That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
2233      To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
2234      That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
2235      In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,
2236      As I do thee. Something too much of this.
2237      There is a Play to night to before the King.
2238      One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
2239      Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
2240      I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
2241      Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
2242      Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
2243      Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
2244      It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
2245      And my Imaginations are as foule
2246      As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
2247      For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
2248      And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
2249      To censure of his seeming

2250         Hora. Well my Lord.
2251      If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
2252      And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
2253      Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
2254      Guildensterne, and
2255      other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish
2256      March. Sound
2257      a Flourish.

2258        Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
2259      Get you a place

2260         King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?
2261        Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
2262      the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so

2263         King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
2264      words are not mine

2265         Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once
2266      i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
2267        Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
2268      Actor

2269         Ham. And what did you enact?
2270        Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
2271      Brutus kill'd me

2272         Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
2273      Calfe there. Be the Players ready?
2274        Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience

2275         Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me

2276         Ha. No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue

2277         Pol. Oh ho, do you marke that?
2278        Ham. Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
2279        Ophe. No my Lord

2280         Ham. I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
2281        Ophe. I my Lord

2282         Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
2283        Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord

2284         Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs
2285        Ophe. What is my Lord?
2286        Ham. Nothing

2287         Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?
2288        Ham. Who I?
2289        Ophe. I my Lord

2290         Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should
2291      a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully
2292      my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
2293      Houres

2294         Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord

2295         Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
2296      for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths
2297      ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a
2298      great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:
2299      But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
2300      he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
2301      Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.

2302      Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters.

2303      Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing
2304      him. She
2305      kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her
2306      vp, and
2307      declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke
2308      of Flowers.
2309      She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,
2310      takes off his
2311      Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and
2312      Exits. The
2313      Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate
2314      Action. The
2315      Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming
2316      to lament
2317      with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the
2318      Queene with
2319      Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,
2320      accepts his
2321      loue.

2322      Exeunt.

2323        Ophe. What meanes this, my Lord?
2324        Ham. Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
2325      Mischeefe

2326         Ophe. Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
2327      Play?
2328        Ham. We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
2329      cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all

2330         Ophe. Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
2331        Ham. I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
2332      you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it
2333      meanes

2334         Ophe. You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
2335      Play.
2336      Enter Prologue.

2337      For vs, and for our Tragedie,
2338      Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
2339      We begge your hearing Patientlie

2340         Ham. Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
2341        Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord

2342         Ham. As Womans loue.
2343      Enter King and his Queene.

2344        King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
2345      Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:
2346      And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
2347      About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
2348      Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
2349      Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands

2350         Bap. So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
2351      Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
2352      But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
2353      So farre from cheere, and from your former state,
2354      That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
2355      Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:
2356      For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
2357      In neither ought, or in extremity:
2358      Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
2359      And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so

2360         King. Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
2361      My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
2362      And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
2363      Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
2364      For Husband shalt thou-
2365        Bap. Oh confound the rest:
2366      Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
2367      In second Husband, let me be accurst,
2368      None wed the second, but who kill'd the first

2369         Ham. Wormwood, Wormwood

2370         Bapt. The instances that second Marriage moue,
2371      Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
2372      A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
2373      When second Husband kisses me in Bed

2374         King. I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
2375      But what we do determine, oft we breake:
2376      Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
2377      Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
2378      Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
2379      But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
2380      Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
2381      To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
2382      What to our selues in passion we propose,
2383      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
2384      The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
2385      Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
2386      Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
2387      Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
2388      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
2389      That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
2390      For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
2391      Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
2392      The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
2393      The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
2394      And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
2395      For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
2396      And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
2397      Directly seasons him his Enemie.
2398      But orderly to end, where I begun,
2399      Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
2400      That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
2401      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
2402      So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
2403      But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead

2404         Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
2405      Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
2406      Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
2407      Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
2408      Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
2409      If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife

2410         Ham. If she should breake it now

2411         King. 'Tis deepely sworne:
2412      Sweet, leaue me heere a while,
2413      My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
2414      The tedious day with sleepe

2415         Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,

2416      Sleepes

2417      And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.

2418      Exit

2419        Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?
2420        Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes

2421         Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word

2422         King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence
2423      in't?
2424        Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence
2425      i'th' world

2426         King. What do you call the Play?
2427        Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:
2428      This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
2429      is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
2430      anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
2431      Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
2432      vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
2433      Enter Lucianus.

2434      This is one Lucianus nephew to the King

2435         Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord

2436         Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
2437      if I could see the Puppets dallying

2438         Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene

2439         Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
2440      edge

2441         Ophe. Still better and worse

2442         Ham. So you mistake Husbands.
2443      Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
2444      begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge

2445         Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,
2446      Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
2447      Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
2448      Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
2449      With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
2450      Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
2451      On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.

2452      Powres the poyson in his eares.

2453        Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
2454      name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
2455      Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
2456      loue of Gonzago's wife

2457         Ophe. The King rises

2458         Ham. What, frighted with false fire

2459         Qu. How fares my Lord?
2460        Pol. Giue o're the Play

2461         King. Giue me some Light. Away

2462         All. Lights, Lights, Lights.

2463      Exeunt.

2464      Manet Hamlet & Horatio.

2465        Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,
2466      The Hart vngalled play:
2467      For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
2468      So runnes the world away.
2469      Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
2470      my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
2471      Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
2472      of Players sir

2473         Hor. Halfe a share

2474         Ham. A whole one I,
2475      For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,
2476      This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,
2477      And now reignes heere.
2478      A verie verie Paiocke

2479         Hora. You might haue Rim'd

2480         Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for
2481      a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?
2482        Hora. Verie well my Lord

2483         Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
2484        Hora. I did verie well note him.
2485      Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.

2486        Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:
2487      For if the King like not the Comedie,
2488      Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
2489      Come some Musicke

2490         Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you

2491         Ham. Sir, a whole History

2492         Guild. The King, sir

2493         Ham. I sir, what of him?
2494        Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd

2495         Ham. With drinke Sir?
2496        Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller

2497         Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,
2498      to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him
2499      to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
2500      more Choller

2501         Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some
2502      frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre

2503         Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce

2504         Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction
2505      of spirit, hath sent me to you

2506         Ham. You are welcome

2507         Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
2508      the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome
2509      answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
2510      if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
2511      my Businesse

2512         Ham. Sir, I cannot

2513         Guild. What, my Lord?
2514        Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
2515      But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:
2516      or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
2517      but to the matter. My Mother you say

2518         Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke
2519      her into amazement, and admiration

2520         Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a
2521      Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers
2522      admiration?
2523        Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,
2524      ere you go to bed

2525         Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
2526      Haue you any further Trade with vs?
2527        Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me

2528         Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers

2529         Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
2530      You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,
2531      if you deny your greefes to your Friend

2532         Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement

2533         Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce of
2534      the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
2535        Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is
2536      something musty.
2537      Enter one with a Recorder.

2538      O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
2539      do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
2540      would driue me into a toyle?
2541        Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
2542      is too vnmannerly

2543         Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
2544      vpon this Pipe?
2545        Guild. My Lord, I cannot

2546         Ham. I pray you

2547         Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot

2548         Ham. I do beseech you

2549         Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord

2550         Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
2551      with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
2552      mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
2553      Looke you, these are the stoppes

2554         Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtterance
2555      of hermony, I haue not the skill

2556         Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
2557      you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
2558      seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
2559      of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
2560      Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,
2561      excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
2562      you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
2563      plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
2564      though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God
2565      blesse you Sir.
2566      Enter Polonius.

2567        Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,
2568      and presently

2569         Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
2570      like a Camell

2571         Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed

2572         Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell

2573         Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell

2574         Ham. Or like a Whale?
2575        Polon. Verie like a Whale

2576         Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
2577      They foole me to the top of my bent.
2578      I will come by and by

2579         Polon. I will say so.
2580      Enter.

2581        Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:
2582      'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
2583      When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out
2584      Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
2585      And do such bitter businesse as the day
2586      Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
2587      Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
2588      The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
2589      Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
2590      I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
2591      My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
2592      How in my words someuer she be shent,
2593      To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
2594      Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.

2595        King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
2596      To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
2597      I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
2598      And he to England shall along with you:
2599      The termes of our estate, may not endure
2600      Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
2601      Out of his Lunacies

2602         Guild. We will our selues prouide:
2603      Most holie and Religious feare it is
2604      To keepe those many many bodies safe
2605      That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie

2606         Rosin. The single
2607      And peculiar life is bound
2608      With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
2609      To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
2610      That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
2611      The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
2612      Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
2613      What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
2614      Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
2615      To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
2616      Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
2617      Each small annexment, pettie consequence
2618      Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
2619      Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone

2620         King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
2621      For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
2622      Which now goes too free-footed

2623         Both. We will haste vs.

2624      Exeunt. Gent.

2625      Enter Polonius.

2626        Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
2627      Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
2628      To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
2629      And as you said, and wisely was it said,
2630      'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
2631      Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare
2632      The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
2633      Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
2634      And tell you what I know

2635         King. Thankes deere my Lord.
2636      Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
2637      It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
2638      A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
2639      Though inclination be as sharpe as will:
2640      My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
2641      And like a man to double businesse bound,
2642      I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
2643      And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
2644      Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
2645      Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
2646      To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
2647      But to confront the visage of Offence?
2648      And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,
2649      To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
2650      Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
2651      My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
2652      Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
2653      That cannot be, since I am still possest
2654      Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
2655      My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
2656      May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
2657      In the corrupted currants of this world,
2658      Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
2659      And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
2660      Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
2661      There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
2662      In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
2663      Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
2664      To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
2665      Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
2666      Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
2667      Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
2668      Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
2669      Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
2670      Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
2671      Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
2672      All may be well.
2673      Enter Hamlet.

2674        Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
2675      And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
2676      And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
2677      A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
2678      I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
2679      To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
2680      He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
2681      With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
2682      And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
2683      But in our circumstance and course of thought
2684      'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
2685      To take him in the purging of his Soule,
2686      When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.
2687      Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
2688      When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
2689      Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,
2690      At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
2691      That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
2692      Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
2693      And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
2694      As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
2695      This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.
2696      Enter.

2697        King. My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
2698      Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.
2699      Enter.

2700      Enter Queene and Polonius.

2701        Pol. He will come straight:
2702      Looke you lay home to him,
2703      Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
2704      And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
2705      Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
2706      Pray you be round with him

2707         Ham. within. Mother, mother, mother

2708         Qu. Ile warrant you, feare me not.
2709      Withdraw, I heare him coming.
2710      Enter Hamlet.

2711        Ham. Now Mother, what's the matter?
2712        Qu. Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended


2713         Ham. Mother, you haue my Father much offended

2714         Qu. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue

2715         Ham. Go, go, you question with an idle tongue

2716         Qu. Why how now Hamlet?
2717        Ham. Whats the matter now?
2718        Qu. Haue you forgot me?
2719        Ham. No by the Rood, not so:
2720      You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
2721      But would you were not so. You are my Mother

2722         Qu. Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake

2723         Ham. Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not
2724      boudge:
2725      You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
2726      Where you may see the inmost part of you?
2727        Qu. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
2728      Helpe, helpe, hoa

2729         Pol. What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe

2730         Ham. How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead

2731         Pol. Oh I am slaine.

2732      Killes Polonius

2733         Qu. Oh me, what hast thou done?
2734        Ham. Nay I know not, is it the King?
2735        Qu. Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
2736        Ham. A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
2737      As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother

2738         Qu. As kill a King?
2739        Ham. I Lady, 'twas my word.
2740      Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
2741      I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
2742      Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
2743      Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
2744      And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
2745      If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
2746      If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
2747      That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense

2748         Qu. What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
2749      In noise so rude against me?
2750        Ham. Such an Act
2751      That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
2752      Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
2753      From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
2754      And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
2755      As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
2756      As from the body of Contraction pluckes
2757      The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
2758      A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
2759      Yea this solidity and compound masse,
2760      With tristfull visage as against the doome,
2761      Is thought-sicke at the act

2762         Qu. Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders
2763      in the Index

2764         Ham. Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
2765      The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
2766      See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
2767      Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
2768      An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
2769      A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
2770      New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:
2771      A Combination, and a forme indeed,
2772      Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
2773      To giue the world assurance of a man.
2774      This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
2775      Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
2776      Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
2777      Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
2778      And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
2779      You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
2780      The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
2781      And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
2782      Would step from this, to this? What diuell was't,
2783      That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
2784      O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,
2785      If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
2786      To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
2787      And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
2788      When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
2789      Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
2790      As Reason panders Will

2791         Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.
2792      Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
2793      And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
2794      As will not leaue their Tinct

2795         Ham. Nay, but to liue
2796      In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
2797      Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
2798      Ouer the nasty Stye

2799         Qu. Oh speake to me, no more,
2800      These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
2801      No more sweet Hamlet

2802         Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:
2803      A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe
2804      Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
2805      A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
2806      That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
2807      And put it in his Pocket

2808         Qu. No more.
2809      Enter Ghost.

2810        Ham. A King of shreds and patches.
2811      Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
2812      You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?
2813        Qu. Alas he's mad

2814         Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
2815      That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
2816      Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say

2817         Ghost. Do not forget: this Visitation
2818      Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
2819      But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
2820      O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
2821      Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
2822      Speake to her Hamlet

2823         Ham. How is it with you Lady?
2824        Qu. Alas, how is't with you?
2825      That you bend your eye on vacancie,
2826      And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
2827      Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
2828      And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
2829      Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
2830      Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
2831      Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
2832      Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
2833        Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
2834      His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
2835      Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
2836      Least with this pitteous action you conuert
2837      My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
2838      Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood

2839         Qu. To who do you speake this?
2840        Ham. Do you see nothing there?
2841        Qu. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see

2842         Ham. Nor did you nothing heare?
2843        Qu. No, nothing but our selues

2844         Ham. Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
2845      My Father in his habite, as he liued,
2846      Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
2847      Enter.

2848        Qu. This is the very coynage of your Braine,
2849      This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in

2850         Ham. Extasie?
2851      My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
2852      And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
2853      That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
2854      And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
2855      Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
2856      Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
2857      That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
2858      It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
2859      Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
2860      Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
2861      Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
2862      And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
2863      To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
2864      For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
2865      Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
2866      Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good

2867         Qu. Oh Hamlet,
2868      Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine

2869         Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,
2870      And liue the purer with the other halfe.
2871      Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
2872      Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
2873      And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
2874      To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,
2875      And when you are desirous to be blest,
2876      Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
2877      I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
2878      To punish me with this, and this with me,
2879      That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
2880      I will bestow him, and will answer well
2881      The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
2882      I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
2883      Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde

2884         Qu. What shall I do?
2885        Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
2886      Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
2887      Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
2888      And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
2889      Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
2890      Make you to rauell all this matter out,
2891      That I essentially am not in madnesse,
2892      But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
2893      For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
2894      Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
2895      Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
2896      No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
2897      Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
2898      Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
2899      To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
2900      And breake your owne necke downe

2901         Qu. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
2902      And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
2903      What thou hast saide to me

2904         Ham. I must to England, you know that?
2905        Qu. Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on

2906         Ham. This man shall set me packing:
2907      Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
2908      Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
2909      Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
2910      Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
2911      Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
2912      Good night Mother.
2913      Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.

2914      Enter King.

2915        King. There's matters in these sighes.
2916      These profound heaues
2917      You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
2918      Where is your Sonne?
2919        Qu. Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
2920        King. What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?
2921        Qu. Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
2922      Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
2923      Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
2924      He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
2925      And in his brainish apprehension killes
2926      The vnseene good old man

2927         King. Oh heauy deed:
2928      It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
2929      His Liberty is full of threats to all,
2930      To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
2931      Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
2932      It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
2933      Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
2934      This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
2935      We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
2936      But like the Owner of a foule disease,
2937      To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
2938      Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
2939        Qu. To draw apart the body he hath kild,
2940      O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
2941      Among a Minerall of Mettels base
2942      Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done

2943         King. Oh Gertrude, come away:
2944      The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
2945      But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
2946      We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
2947      Both countenance, and excuse.
2948      Enter Ros. & Guild.

2949      Ho Guildenstern:
2950      Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
2951      Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,
2952      And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
2953      Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
2954      Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
2955      Exit Gent.

2956      Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
2957      To let them know both what we meane to do,
2958      And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
2959      My soule is full of discord and dismay.

2960      Exeunt.

2961      Enter Hamlet.

2962        Ham. Safely stowed

2963         Gentlemen within. Hamlet, Lord Hamlet

2964         Ham. What noise? Who cals on Hamlet?
2965      Oh heere they come.
2966      Enter Ros. and Guildensterne.

2967        Ro. What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
2968        Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne

2969         Rosin. Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
2970      And beare it to the Chappell

2971         Ham. Do not beleeue it

2972         Rosin. Beleeue what?
2973        Ham. That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine
2974      owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication
2975      should be made by the Sonne of a King

2976         Rosin. Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
2977        Ham. I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
2978      Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
2979      best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in
2980      the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
2981      when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing
2982      you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe

2983         Rosin. I vnderstand you not my Lord

2984         Ham. I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
2985      foolish eare

2986         Rosin. My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,
2987      and go with vs to the King

2988         Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not
2989      with the body. The King, is a thing-
2990        Guild. A thing my Lord?
2991        Ham. Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
2992      after.

2993      Exeunt.

2994      Enter King.

2995        King. I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
2996      How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
2997      Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
2998      Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
2999      Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
3000      And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
3001      But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
3002      This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
3003      Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
3004      By desperate appliance are releeued,
3005      Or not at all.
3006      Enter Rosincrane.

3007      How now? What hath befalne?
3008        Rosin. Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
3009      We cannot get from him

3010         King. But where is he?
3011        Rosin. Without my Lord, guarded to know your
3012      pleasure

3013         King. Bring him before vs

3014         Rosin. Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord.
3015      Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne.

3016        King. Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
3017        Ham. At Supper

3018         King. At Supper? Where?
3019        Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
3020      conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm
3021      is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
3022      to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,
3023      and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
3024      but to one Table that's the end

3025         King. What dost thou meane by this?
3026        Ham. Nothing but to shew you how a King may go
3027      a Progresse through the guts of a Begger

3028         King. Where is Polonius

3029         Ham. In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger
3030      finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your
3031      selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you
3032      shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby

3033         King. Go seeke him there

3034         Ham. He will stay till ye come

3035         K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
3036      Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
3037      For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
3038      With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,
3039      The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
3040      Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent
3041      For England

3042         Ham. For England?
3043        King. I Hamlet

3044         Ham. Good

3045         King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes

3046         Ham. I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
3047      England. Farewell deere Mother

3048         King. Thy louing Father Hamlet

3049         Hamlet. My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
3050      wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
3051      for England.

3052      Exit

3053        King. Follow him at foote,
3054      Tempt him with speed aboord:
3055      Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
3056      Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
3057      That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.
3058      And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
3059      As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
3060      Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
3061      After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
3062      Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
3063      Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
3064      By Letters coniuring to that effect
3065      The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,
3066      For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
3067      And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
3068      How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.

3069      Exit

3070      Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.

3071        For. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
3072      Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
3073      Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
3074      Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
3075      If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
3076      We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
3077      And let him know so

3078         Cap. I will doo't, my Lord

3079         For. Go safely on.
3080      Enter.

3081      Enter Queene and Horatio.

3082        Qu. I will not speake with her

3083         Hor. She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode
3084      will needs be pittied

3085         Qu. What would she haue?
3086        Hor. She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
3087      There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
3088      Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
3089      That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
3090      Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
3091      The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
3092      And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
3093      Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
3094      Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
3095      Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily

3096         Qu. 'Twere good she were spoken with,
3097      For she may strew dangerous coniectures
3098      In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
3099      To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)
3100      Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
3101      So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
3102      It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
3103      Enter Ophelia distracted.

3104        Ophe. Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark

3105         Qu. How now Ophelia?
3106        Ophe. How should I your true loue know from another one?
3107      By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone

3108         Qu. Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
3109        Ophe. Say you? Nay pray you marke.
3110      He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,
3111      At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
3112      Enter King.

3113        Qu. Nay but Ophelia

3114         Ophe. Pray you marke.
3115      White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow

3116         Qu. Alas, looke heere my Lord

3117         Ophe. Larded with sweet Flowers:
3118      Which bewept to the graue did not go,
3119      With true-loue showres

3120         King. How do ye, pretty Lady?
3121        Ophe. Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
3122      a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
3123      know not what we may be. God be at your Table

3124         King. Conceit vpon her Father

3125         Ophe. Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when
3126      they aske you what it meanes, say you this:
3127      To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, all in the morning betime,
3128      And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
3129      Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore,
3130      Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more

3131         King. Pretty Ophelia

3132         Ophe. Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont.
3133      By gis, and by S[aint]. Charity,
3134      Alacke, and fie for shame:
3135      Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
3136      By Cocke they are too blame.
3137      Quoth she before you tumbled me,
3138      You promis'd me to Wed:
3139      So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,
3140      And thou hadst not come to my bed

3141         King. How long hath she bin thus?
3142        Ophe. I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,
3143      but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
3144      lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
3145      and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my
3146      Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
3147      Goodnight, goodnight.
3148      Enter.

3149        King. Follow her close,
3150      Giue her good watch I pray you:
3151      Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
3152      All from her Fathers death. Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,
3153      When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
3154      But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine,
3155      Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
3156      Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
3157      Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
3158      For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly
3159      In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia
3160      Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
3161      Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
3162      Last, and as much containing as all these,
3163      Her Brother is in secret come from France,
3164      Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
3165      And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
3166      With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
3167      Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
3168      Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
3169      In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this,
3170      Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
3171      Giues me superfluous death.

3172      A Noise within.

3173      Enter a Messenger.

3174        Qu. Alacke, what noyse is this?
3175        King. Where are my Switzers?
3176      Let them guard the doore. What is the matter?
3177        Mes. Saue your selfe, my Lord.
3178      The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List)
3179      Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
3180      Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head,
3181      Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
3182      And as the world were now but to begin,
3183      Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
3184      The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
3185      They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
3186      Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
3187      Laertes shall be King, Laertes King

3188         Qu. How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
3189      Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.

3190      Noise within. Enter Laertes.

3191        King. The doores are broke

3192         Laer. Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without

3193         All. No, let's come in

3194         Laer. I pray you giue me leaue

3195         Al. We will, we will

3197      Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father

3198         Qu. Calmely good Laertes

3199         Laer. That drop of blood, that calmes
3200      Proclaimes me Bastard:
3201      Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
3202      Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
3203      Of my true Mother

3204         King. What is the cause Laertes,
3205      That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
3206      Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:
3207      There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
3208      That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
3209      Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,
3210      Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude.
3211      Speake man

3212         Laer. Where's my Father?
3213        King. Dead

3214         Qu. But not by him

3215         King. Let him demand his fill

3216         Laer. How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
3217      To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
3218      Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
3219      I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
3220      That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
3221      Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
3222      Most throughly for my Father

3223         King. Who shall stay you?
3224        Laer. My Will, not all the world,
3225      And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
3226      They shall go farre with little

3227         King. Good Laertes:
3228      If you desire to know the certaintie
3229      Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
3230      That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
3231      Winner and Looser

3232         Laer. None but his Enemies

3233         King. Will you know them then

3234         La. To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
3235      And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
3236      Repast them with my blood

3237         King. Why now you speake
3238      Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
3239      That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
3240      And am most sensible in greefe for it,
3241      It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
3242      As day do's to your eye.

3243      A noise within. Let her come in.

3244      Enter Ophelia.

3245        Laer. How now? what noise is that?
3246      Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
3247      Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
3248      By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
3249      Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May,
3250      Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
3251      Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
3252      Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
3253      Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
3254      It sends some precious instance of it selfe
3255      After the thing it loues

3256         Ophe. They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
3257      Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
3258      And on his graue raines many a teare,
3259      Fare you well my Doue

3260         Laer. Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,
3261      it could not moue thus

3262         Ophe. You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
3263      him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is
3264      the false Steward that stole his masters daughter

3265         Laer. This nothings more then matter

3266         Ophe. There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
3267      Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
3268      Thoughts

3269         Laer. A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance
3270      fitted

3271         Ophe. There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
3272      Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
3273      Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
3274      with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you
3275      some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
3276      They say, he made a good end;
3277      For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy

3278         Laer. Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
3279      She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse

3280         Ophe. And will he not come againe,
3281      And will he not come againe:
3282      No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,
3283      He neuer wil come againe.
3284      His Beard as white as Snow,
3285      All Flaxen was his Pole:
3286      He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
3287      Gramercy on his Soule.
3288      And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
3289      God buy ye.

3290      Exeunt. Ophelia

3291        Laer. Do you see this, you Gods?
3292        King. Laertes, I must common with your greefe,
3293      Or you deny me right: go but apart,
3294      Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
3295      And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
3296      If by direct or by Colaterall hand
3297      They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
3298      Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
3299      To you in satisfaction. But if not,
3300      Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
3301      And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
3302      To giue it due content

3303         Laer. Let this be so:
3304      His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
3305      No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
3306      No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
3307      Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
3308      That I must call in question

3309         King. So you shall:
3310      And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
3311      I pray you go with me.

3312      Exeunt.

3313      Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.

3314        Hora. What are they that would speake with me?
3315        Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you

3316         Hor. Let them come in,
3317      I do not know from what part of the world
3318      I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
3319      Enter Saylor.

3320        Say. God blesse you Sir

3321         Hor. Let him blesse thee too

3322         Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter
3323      for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
3324      bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
3325      to know it is.

3326      Reads the Letter.

3327      Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these
3328      Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters
3329      for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
3330      Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too
3331      slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I
3332      boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so
3333      I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like
3334      Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe
3335      a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue
3336      sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest
3337      flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee
3338      dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.
3339      These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance
3340      and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them
3341      I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.
3342      He that thou knowest thine,
3343      Hamlet.
3344      Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
3345      And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
3346      To him from whom you brought them.
3347      Enter.

3348      Enter King and Laertes.

3349        King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
3350      And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
3351      Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
3352      That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
3353      Pursued my life

3354         Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,
3355      Why you proceeded not against these feates,
3356      So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
3357      As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
3358      You mainly were stirr'd vp?
3359        King. O for two speciall Reasons,
3360      Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,
3361      And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
3362      Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
3363      My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
3364      She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
3365      That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
3366      I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
3367      Why to a publike count I might not go,
3368      Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
3369      Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
3370      Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
3371      Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
3372      Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
3373      Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
3374      And not where I had arm'd them

3375         Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
3376      A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
3377      Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
3378      Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
3379      For her perfections. But my reuenge will come

3380         King. Breake not your sleepes for that,
3381      You must not thinke
3382      That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
3383      That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
3384      And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
3385      I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
3386      And that I hope will teach you to imagine-
3387      Enter a Messenger.

3388      How now? What Newes?
3389        Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your
3390      Maiesty: this to the Queene

3391         King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
3392        Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
3393      They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them

3394         King. Laertes you shall heare them:
3395      Leaue vs.

3396      Exit Messenger

3397      High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
3398      Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly
3399      Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount
3400      th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
3401      Hamlet.
3402      What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
3403      Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
3404        Laer. Know you the hand?
3405        Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript
3406      here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
3407        Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
3408      It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
3409      That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
3410      Thus diddest thou

3411         Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:
3412      How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
3413        Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace

3414         Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
3415      As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
3416      No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
3417      To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
3418      Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
3419      And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
3420      But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
3421      And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
3422      Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
3423      I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
3424      And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
3425      Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
3426      And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
3427      As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
3428      With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
3429      That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
3430      Come short of what he did

3431         Laer. A Norman was't?
3432        Kin. A Norman

3433         Laer. Vpon my life Lamound

3434         Kin. The very same

3435         Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
3436      And Iemme of all our Nation

3437         Kin. Hee mad confession of you,
3438      And gaue you such a Masterly report,
3439      For Art and exercise in your defence;
3440      And for your Rapier most especiall,
3441      That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
3442      If one could match you Sir. This report of his
3443      Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,
3444      That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
3445      Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
3446      Now out of this

3447         Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?
3448        Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?
3449      Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
3450      A face without a heart?
3451        Laer. Why aske you this?
3452        Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
3453      But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
3454      And that I see in passages of proofe,
3455      Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
3456      Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,
3457      To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
3458      More then in words?
3459        Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church

3460         Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
3461      Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes
3462      Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
3463      Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:
3464      Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
3465      And set a double varnish on the fame
3466      The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
3467      And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
3468      Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
3469      Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
3470      Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
3471      A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
3472      Requit him for your Father

3473         Laer. I will doo't.
3474      And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
3475      I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
3476      So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
3477      Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
3478      Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
3479      Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
3480      That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
3481      With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
3482      It may be death

3483         Kin. Let's further thinke of this,
3484      Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
3485      May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
3486      And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
3487      'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
3488      Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
3489      If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
3490      Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
3491      I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,
3492      As make your bowts more violent to the end,
3493      And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
3494      A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
3495      If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
3496      Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
3497      Enter Queene.

3498        Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
3499      So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes

3500         Laer. Drown'd! O where?
3501        Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
3502      That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
3503      There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
3504      Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
3505      That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
3506      But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
3507      There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
3508      Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
3509      When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
3510      Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
3511      And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
3512      Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
3513      As one incapable of her owne distresse,
3514      Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
3515      Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
3516      Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
3517      Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
3518      To muddy death

3519         Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?
3520        Queen. Drown'd, drown'd

3521         Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,
3522      And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
3523      It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
3524      Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
3525      The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
3526      I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
3527      But that this folly doubts it.
3528      Enter.

3529        Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:
3530      How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
3531      Now feare I this will giue it start againe;
3532      Therefore let's follow.

3533      Exeunt.

3534      Enter two Clownes.

3535        Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
3536      wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
3537        Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
3538      straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
3539      buriall

3540         Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
3541      her owne defence?
3542        Other. Why 'tis found so

3543         Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
3544      heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues
3545      an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
3546      Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
3547      wittingly

3548         Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer

3549         Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
3550      heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
3551      and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
3552      marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne
3553      him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not
3554      guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life

3555         Other. But is this law?
3556        Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law

3557         Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not
3558      beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
3559      out of Christian Buriall

3560         Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that
3561      great folke should haue countenance in this world to
3562      drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
3563      Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
3564      but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp
3565      Adams Profession

3566         Other. Was he a Gentleman?
3567        Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes

3568         Other. Why he had none

3569         Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand
3570      the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;
3571      could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question
3572      to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse
3573      thy selfe-
3574        Other. Go too

3575         Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the
3576      Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
3577        Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a
3578      thousand Tenants

3579         Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
3580      does well; but how does it well? it does well to those
3581      that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
3582      built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
3583      may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come

3584         Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,
3585      or a Carpenter?
3586        Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake

3587         Other. Marry, now I can tell

3588         Clo. Too't

3589         Other. Masse, I cannot tell.
3590      Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.

3591        Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
3592      dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
3593      you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the
3594      Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
3595      to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.

3596      Sings.

3597      In youth when I did loue, did loue,
3598      me thought it was very sweete:
3599      To contract O the time for a my behoue,
3600      O me thought there was nothing meete

3601         Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that
3602      he sings at Graue-making?
3603        Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse

3604         Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
3605      the daintier sense

3606         Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps
3607      hath caught me in his clutch:
3608      And hath shipped me intill the Land,
3609      as if I had neuer beene such

3610         Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
3611      once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
3612      were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It
3613      might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
3614      one that could circumuent God, might it not?
3615        Hor. It might, my Lord

3616         Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
3617      sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
3618      might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
3619      a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
3620        Hor. I, my Lord

3621         Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
3622      Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
3623      Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
3624      see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
3625      to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke
3626      on't

3627         Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
3628      for and a shrowding-Sheete:
3629      O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
3630      for such a Guest is meete

3631         Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the
3632      Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his
3633      Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why
3634      doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
3635      the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
3636      his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
3637      time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
3638      his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
3639      Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,
3640      to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his
3641      Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double
3642      ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
3643      Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
3644      hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
3645      haue no more? ha?
3646        Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord

3647         Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
3648        Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too

3649         Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
3650      in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
3651      this Sir?
3652        Clo. Mine Sir:
3653      O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
3654      for such a Guest is meete

3655         Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't

3656         Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
3657      for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine

3658         Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
3659      'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
3660      lyest

3661         Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
3662      to you

3663         Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?
3664        Clo. For no man Sir

3665         Ham. What woman then?
3666        Clo. For none neither

3667         Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
3668        Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,
3669      shee's dead

3670         Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake
3671      by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
3672      Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
3673      the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
3674      comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
3675      Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
3676        Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
3677      that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras

3678         Ham. How long is that since?
3679        Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:
3680      It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee
3681      that was mad, and sent into England

3682         Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?
3683        Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his
3684      wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there

3685         Ham. Why?
3686        Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
3687      mad as he

3688         Ham. How came he mad?
3689        Clo. Very strangely they say

3690         Ham. How strangely?
3691        Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits

3692         Ham. Vpon what ground?
3693        Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene
3694      heere, man and Boy thirty yeares

3695         Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
3696        Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
3697      many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
3698      the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
3699      yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare

3700         Ham. Why he, more then another?
3701        Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
3702      he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,
3703      is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull
3704      now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years

3705         Ham. Whose was it?
3706        Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
3707      Whose doe you thinke it was?
3708        Ham. Nay, I know not

3709         Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a
3710      Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull
3711      Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester

3712         Ham. This?
3713        Clo. E'ene that

3714         Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
3715      a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
3716      hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
3717      abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere
3718      hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
3719      Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your
3720      Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
3721      set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own
3722      Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies
3723      Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
3724      fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee
3725      Horatio tell me one thing

3726         Hor. What's that my Lord?
3727        Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
3728      i'th' earth?
3729        Hor. E'ene so

3730         Ham. And smelt so? Puh

3731         Hor. E'ene so, my Lord

3732         Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.
3733      Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
3734      till he find it stopping a bunghole

3735         Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so

3736         Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
3737      with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
3738      Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth
3739      into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
3740      Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)
3741      might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
3742      Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
3743      Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
3744      Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
3745      Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
3746      But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
3747      Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.

3748      The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
3749      And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
3750      The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
3751      Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
3752      Couch we a while, and mark

3753         Laer. What Cerimony else?
3754        Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke

3755         Laer. What Cerimony else?
3756        Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
3757      As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,
3758      And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
3759      She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
3760      Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
3761      Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
3762      Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
3763      Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
3764      Of Bell and Buriall

3765         Laer. Must there no more be done ?
3766        Priest. No more be done:
3767      We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
3768      To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her
3769      As to peace-parted Soules

3770         Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,
3771      And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
3772      May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)
3773      A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
3774      When thou liest howling?
3775        Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?
3776        Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
3777      I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:
3778      I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)
3779      And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue

3780         Laer. Oh terrible woer,
3781      Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
3782      Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
3783      Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,
3784      Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:

3785      Leaps in the graue.

3786      Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
3787      Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
3788      To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
3789      Of blew Olympus

3790         Ham. What is he, whose griefes
3791      Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
3792      Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
3793      Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
3794      Hamlet the Dane

3795         Laer. The deuill take thy soule

3796         Ham. Thou prai'st not well,
3797      I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
3798      Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
3799      Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
3800      Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand

3801         King. Pluck them asunder

3802         Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet

3803         Gen. Good my Lord be quiet

3804         Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
3805      Vntill my eielids will no longer wag

3806         Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
3807        Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers
3808      Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)
3809      Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
3810        King. Oh he is mad Laertes,
3811        Qu. For loue of God forbeare him

3812         Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.
3813      Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
3814      Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
3815      Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
3816      To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
3817      Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
3818      And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
3819      Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
3820      Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
3821      Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,
3822      Ile rant as well as thou

3823         Kin. This is meere Madnesse:
3824      And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
3825      Anon as patient as the female Doue,
3826      When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
3827      His silence will sit drooping

3828         Ham. Heare you Sir:
3829      What is the reason that you vse me thus?
3830      I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:
3831      Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,
3832      The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
3833      Enter.

3834        Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,
3835      Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,
3836      Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
3837      Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,
3838      This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
3839      An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
3840      Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

3841      Exeunt.

3842      Enter Hamlet and Horatio

3843         Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
3844      You doe remember all the Circumstance

3845         Hor. Remember it my Lord?
3846        Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
3847      That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
3848      Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
3849      (And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
3850      Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
3851      When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
3852      There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
3853      Rough-hew them how we will

3854         Hor. That is most certaine

3855         Ham. Vp from my Cabin
3856      My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,
3857      Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
3858      Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
3859      To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
3860      (My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
3861      Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,
3862      Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
3863      Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
3864      Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
3865      With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
3866      That on the superuize no leasure bated,
3867      No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
3868      My head should be struck off

3869         Hor. Ist possible?
3870        Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
3871      But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
3872        Hor. I beseech you

3873         Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
3874      Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
3875      They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
3876      Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
3877      I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
3878      A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
3879      How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
3880      It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know
3881      The effects of what I wrote?
3882        Hor. I, good my Lord

3883         Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,
3884      As England was his faithfull Tributary,
3885      As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
3886      As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
3887      And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
3888      And many such like Assis of great charge,
3889      That on the view and know of these Contents,
3890      Without debatement further, more or lesse,
3891      He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
3892      Not shriuing time allowed

3893         Hor. How was this seal'd?
3894        Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
3895      I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
3896      Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
3897      Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
3898      Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
3899      The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
3900      Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
3901      Thou know'st already

3902         Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't

3903         Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
3904      They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
3905      Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
3906      'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
3907      Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
3908      Of mighty opposites

3909         Hor. Why, what a King is this?
3910        Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
3911      He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
3912      Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
3913      Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
3914      And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
3915      To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
3916      To let this Canker of our nature come
3917      In further euill

3918         Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England
3919      What is the issue of the businesse there

3920         Ham. It will be short,
3921      The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more
3922      Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,
3923      That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
3924      For by the image of my Cause, I see
3925      The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
3926      But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
3927      Into a Towring passion

3928         Hor. Peace, who comes heere?
3929      Enter young Osricke.

3930        Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke

3931         Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
3932        Hor. No my good Lord

3933         Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
3934      know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
3935      be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
3936      Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession
3937      of dirt

3938         Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,
3939      I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty

3940         Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put
3941      your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head

3942         Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot

3943         Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
3944      Northerly

3945         Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed

3946         Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
3947      Complexion

3948         Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
3949      I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie
3950      to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
3951      Sir, this is the matter

3952         Ham. I beseech you remember

3953         Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
3954      Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
3955      his weapon

3956         Ham. What's his weapon?
3957        Osr. Rapier and dagger

3958         Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well

3959         Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
3960      against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
3961      Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
3962      Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
3963      deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
3964      carriages, and of very liberall conceit

3965         Ham. What call you the Carriages?
3966        Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers

3967         Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
3968      matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
3969      it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses
3970      against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
3971      liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against
3972      the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
3973        Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
3974      you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
3975      He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
3976      imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
3977      Answere

3978         Ham. How if I answere no?
3979        Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
3980      in tryall

3981         Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
3982      his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
3983      the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
3984      King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
3985      not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits

3986         Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
3987        Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature
3988      will

3989         Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship

3990         Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it
3991      himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue

3992         Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
3993      head

3994         Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
3995      suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
3996      that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
3997      the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
3998      yesty collection, which carries them through & through
3999      the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
4000      them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out

4001         Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord

4002         Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
4003      I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
4004      oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about
4005      my heart: but it is no matter

4006         Hor. Nay, good my Lord

4007         Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of
4008      gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman

4009         Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall
4010      their repaire hither, and say you are not fit

4011         Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
4012      Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
4013      to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
4014      be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
4015      man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?
4016      Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
4017      Foyles,
4018      and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.

4019        Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me

4020         Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
4021      But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
4022      This presence knowes,
4023      And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht
4024      With sore distraction? What I haue done
4025      That might your nature honour, and exception
4026      Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
4027      Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.
4028      If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
4029      And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
4030      Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
4031      Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
4032      Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
4033      His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
4034      Sir, in this Audience,
4035      Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
4036      Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
4037      That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
4038      And hurt my Mother

4039         Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,
4040      Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
4041      To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
4042      I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
4043      Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
4044      I haue a voyce, and president of peace
4045      To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
4046      I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
4047      And wil not wrong it

4048         Ham. I do embrace it freely,
4049      And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
4050      Giue vs the Foyles: Come on

4051         Laer. Come one for me

4052         Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
4053      Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
4054      Sticke fiery off indeede

4055         Laer. You mocke me Sir

4056         Ham. No by this hand

4057         King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,
4058      Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager

4059         Ham. Verie well my Lord,
4060      Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side

4061         King. I do not feare it,
4062      I haue seene you both:
4063      But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes

4064         Laer. This is too heauy,
4065      Let me see another

4066         Ham. This likes me well,
4067      These Foyles haue all a length.

4068      Prepare to play.

4069        Osricke. I my good Lord

4070         King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
4071      If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,
4072      Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
4073      Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
4074      The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
4075      And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
4076      Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
4077      In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
4078      Giue me the Cups,
4079      And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
4080      The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
4081      The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
4082      Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,
4083      And you the Iudges beare a wary eye

4084         Ham. Come on sir

4085         Laer. Come on sir.

4086      They play.

4087        Ham. One

4088         Laer. No

4089         Ham. Iudgement

4090         Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit

4091         Laer. Well: againe

4092         King. Stay, giue me drinke.
4093      Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
4094      Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,

4095      Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.

4096        Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
4097      Come: Another hit; what say you?
4098        Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse

4099         King. Our Sonne shall win

4100         Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.
4101      Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
4102      The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet

4103         Ham. Good Madam

4104         King. Gertrude, do not drinke

4105         Qu. I will my Lord;
4106      I pray you pardon me

4107         King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late

4108         Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,
4109      By and by

4110         Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face

4111         Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now

4112         King. I do not thinke't

4113         Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience

4114         Ham. Come for the third.
4115      Laertes, you but dally,
4116      I pray you passe with your best violence,
4117      I am affear'd you make a wanton of me

4118         Laer. Say you so? Come on.

4119      Play.

4120        Osr. Nothing neither way

4121         Laer. Haue at you now.

4122      In scuffling they change Rapiers.

4123        King. Part them, they are incens'd

4124         Ham. Nay come, againe

4125         Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa

4126         Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?
4127        Osr. How is't Laertes?
4128        Laer. Why as a Woodcocke
4129      To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
4130      I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie

4131         Ham. How does the Queene?
4132        King. She sounds to see them bleede

4133         Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
4134      Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,
4135      I am poyson'd

4136         Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
4137      Treacherie, seeke it out

4138         Laer. It is heere Hamlet.
4139      Hamlet, thou art slaine,
4140      No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
4141      In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
4142      The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
4143      Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
4144      Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
4145      Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
4146      I can no more, the King, the King's too blame

4147         Ham. The point envenom'd too,
4148      Then venome to thy worke.

4149      Hurts the King.

4150        All. Treason, Treason

4151         King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt

4152         Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,
4153      Damned Dane,
4154      Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
4155      Follow my Mother.

4156      King Dyes.

4157        Laer. He is iustly seru'd.
4158      It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
4159      Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
4160      Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
4161      Nor thine on me.

4162      Dyes.

4163        Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
4164      I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,
4165      You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
4166      That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
4167      Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
4168      Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
4169      But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
4170      Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
4171      To the vnsatisfied

4172         Hor. Neuer beleeue it.
4173      I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
4174      Heere's yet some Liquor left

4175         Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
4176      Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
4177      Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,
4178      (Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
4179      If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
4180      Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
4181      And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
4182      To tell my Storie.

4183      March afarre off, and shout within.

4184      What warlike noyse is this?
4185      Enter Osricke.

4186        Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland
4187      To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly

4188         Ham. O I dye Horatio:
4189      The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,
4190      I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
4191      But I do prophesie th' election lights
4192      On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
4193      So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
4194      Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.

4195      Dyes

4196        Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:
4197      Goodnight sweet Prince,
4198      And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
4199      Why do's the Drumme come hither?
4200      Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,
4201      and
4202      Attendants.

4203        Fortin. Where is this sight?
4204        Hor. What is it ye would see;
4205      If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search

4206         For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
4207      What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
4208      That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
4209      So bloodily hast strooke

4210         Amb. The sight is dismall,
4211      And our affaires from England come too late,
4212      The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
4213      To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
4214      That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
4215      Where should we haue our thankes?
4216        Hor. Not from his mouth,
4217      Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:
4218      He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
4219      But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
4220      You from the Polake warres, and you from England
4221      Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
4222      High on a stage be placed to the view,
4223      And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
4224      How these things came about. So shall you heare
4225      Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
4226      Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
4227      Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
4228      And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
4229      Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I
4230      Truly deliuer

4231         For. Let vs hast to heare it,
4232      And call the Noblest to the Audience.
4233      For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
4234      I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
4235      Which are to claime, my vantage doth
4236      Inuite me,
4237        Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
4238      And from his mouth
4239      Whose voyce will draw on more:
4240      But let this same be presently perform'd,
4241      Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
4242      Lest more mischance
4243      On plots, and errors happen

4244         For. Let foure Captaines
4245      Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,
4246      For he was likely, had he beene put on
4247      To haue prou'd most royally:
4248      And for his passage,
4249      The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
4250      Speake lowdly for him.
4251      Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
4252      Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
4253      Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.

4254      Exeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot
4255      off.


4256      FINIS. The tragedie of HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.
