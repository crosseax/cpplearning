40        Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
41        all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
42        copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
43        of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
44        
45        
46        We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
47        of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
48        
49        Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
50        midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
51        The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
52        Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
53        preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
54        and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
55        up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
56        in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
57        a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
58        look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
59        new copy has at least one byte more or less.

63        
64        We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
65        time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
66        to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
67        searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
68        projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
69        per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
70        million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
71        files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
72        If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
73        total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
74        
75        The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
76        Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
77        This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
78        which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
79        
80        At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
81        of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
82        manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
83        from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
84        assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
85        more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
86        don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

146       Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
147       They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
148       your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
149       someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
150       fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
151       disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
152       you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
153       
154       *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
155       By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
156       etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
157       this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
158       a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by

162       
163       ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
164       This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
165       tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
166       Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
167       Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
168       things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
169       on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
170       distribute it in the United States without permission and
171       without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
172       below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
173       under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
174       
175       To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
176       efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
177       works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
178       medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
179       things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
180       corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
181       intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
182       disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
183       codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
184       
185       LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
186       But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
187       [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
188       etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
189       liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
190       legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
191       UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
192       INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
193       OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
194       POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
195       
196       If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
197       receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
198       you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
199       time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
200       on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
201       such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
202       copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
203       choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
204       receive it electronically.

211       
212       Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
213       the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the

289       Executive Director's Notes:
290       
291       In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
292       the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
293       been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
294       are presented herein:
295       
296         Barnardo. Who's there?
297         Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
298       your selfe
299       
300          Bar. Long liue the King
301       
302       ***
303       
304       As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
305       or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
306       original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
307       to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
308       that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
309       above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
310       Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
311       
312       The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
313       time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
314       place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
315       as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
316       more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
317       
318       You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
319       have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
320       extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
321       very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
322       assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
323       in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
324       purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
325       . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
326       that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
327       variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
328       for signing his name with several different spellings.
329       
330       So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
331       made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
332       that are "not" errors. . . .
333       
334       So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
335       here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie 
336       of Hamlet.

346       Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
347       a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can 
348       come in ASCII to the printed text.
349       
350       The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
351       conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
352       punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
353       printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
354       together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
355       Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
356       spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
357       abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
358       brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
359       you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
360       purer Shakespeare.
361       
362       Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
363       differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
364       be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
365       this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
366       habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and

383       Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
384       
385       Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.
386       
387         Barnardo. Who's there?
388         Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
389       your selfe
390       
391          Bar. Long liue the King
392       
393          Fran. Barnardo?
394         Bar. He
395       
396          Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre
397       
398          Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco
399       
400          Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
401       And I am sicke at heart
402       
403          Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?
404         Fran. Not a Mouse stirring
405       
406          Barn. Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio and
407       Marcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
408       Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
409       
410         Fran. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?
411         Hor. Friends to this ground
412       
413          Mar. And Leige-men to the Dane
414       
415          Fran. Giue you good night
416       
417          Mar. O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?
418         Fra. Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.
419       
420       Exit Fran.
421       
422         Mar. Holla Barnardo
423       
424          Bar. Say, what is Horatio there?
425         Hor. A peece of him
426       
427          Bar. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus
428       
429          Mar. What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night
430       
431          Bar. I haue seene nothing
432       
433          Mar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
434       And will not let beleefe take hold of him
435       Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
436       Therefore I haue intreated him along
437       With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
438       That if againe this Apparition come,
439       He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
440       
441          Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
442       
443          Bar. Sit downe a-while,
444       And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
445       That are so fortified against our Story,
446       What we two Nights haue seene
447       
448          Hor. Well, sit we downe,
449       And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
450       
451          Barn. Last night of all,
452       When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
453       Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
454       Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
455       The Bell then beating one
456       
457          Mar. Peace, breake thee of:
458       Enter the Ghost.
459       
460       Looke where it comes againe
461       
462          Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead
463       
464          Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio
465       
466          Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio
467       
468          Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
469         Barn. It would be spoke too
470       
471          Mar. Question it Horatio
472       
473          Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
474       Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
475       In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
476       Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake
477       
478          Mar. It is offended
479       
480          Barn. See, it stalkes away
481       
482          Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
483       
484       Exit the Ghost.
485       
486         Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer
487       
488          Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
489       Is not this something more then Fantasie?
490       What thinke you on't?
491         Hor. Before my God, I might not this beleeue
492       Without the sensible and true auouch
493       Of mine owne eyes
494       
495          Mar. Is it not like the King?
496         Hor. As thou art to thy selfe,
497       Such was the very Armour he had on,
498       When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
499       So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
500       He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
501       'Tis strange
502       
503          Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
504       With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch
505       
506          Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:
507       But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
508       This boades some strange erruption to our State
509       
510          Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
511       Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
512       So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
513       And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
514       And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
515       Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
516       Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
517       What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
518       Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
519       Who is't that can informe me?
520         Hor. That can I,
521       At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
522       Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
523       Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
524       (Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
525       Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
526       (For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
527       Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
528       Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
529       Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
530       Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
531       Against the which, a Moity competent
532       Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
533       To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
534       Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
535       And carriage of the Article designe,
536       His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
537       Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
538       Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
539       Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
540       For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
541       That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
542       (And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
543       But to recouer of vs by strong hand
544       And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
545       So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
546       Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
547       The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
548       Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
549       Enter Ghost againe.
550       
551       But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
552       Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
553       If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
554       Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
555       That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
556       If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
557       (Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
558       Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
559       Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
560       (For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
561       Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus
562       
563          Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
564         Hor. Do, if it will not stand
565       
566          Barn. 'Tis heere
567       
568          Hor. 'Tis heere
569       
570          Mar. 'Tis gone.
571       
572       Exit Ghost.
573       
574       We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
575       To offer it the shew of Violence,
576       For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
577       And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery
578       
579          Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew
580       
581          Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
582       Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
583       The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
584       Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
585       Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
586       Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
587       Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
588       To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
589       This present Obiect made probation
590       
591          Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
592       Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
593       Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
594       The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
595       And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
596       The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
597       No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
598       So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time
599       
600          Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
601       But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
602       Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
603       Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
604       Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
605       Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
606       This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
607       Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
608       As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
609         Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
610       Where we shall finde him most conueniently.
611       
612       Exeunt.
613       
614       Scena Secunda.
615       
616       Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,
617       Polonius,
618       Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.
619       
620         King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death
621       The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
622       To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
623       To be contracted in one brow of woe:
624       Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
625       That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
626       Together with remembrance of our selues.
627       Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
628       Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
629       Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
630       With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
631       With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
632       In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
633       Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
634       Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
635       With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
636       Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,
637       Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
638       Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
639       Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
640       Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
641       He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
642       Importing the surrender of those Lands
643       Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
644       To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
645       Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.
646       
647       Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
648       Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
649       To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,
650       Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
651       Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
652       His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
653       The Lists, and full proportions are all made
654       Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
655       You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,
656       For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
657       Giuing to you no further personall power
658       To businesse with the King, more then the scope
659       Of these dilated Articles allow:
660       Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty
661       
662          Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty
663       
664          King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.
665       
666       Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.
667       
668       And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
669       You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?
670       You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
671       And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
672       That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
673       The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
674       The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,
675       Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
676       What would'st thou haue Laertes?
677         Laer. Dread my Lord,
678       Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
679       From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
680       To shew my duty in your Coronation,
681       Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
682       My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
683       And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon
684       
685          King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?
686       What sayes Pollonius?
687         Pol. He hath my Lord:
688       I do beseech you giue him leaue to go
689       
690          King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,
691       And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
692       But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
693         Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde
694       
695          King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
696         Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun
697       
698          Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,
699       And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
700       Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
701       Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
702       Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
703       Passing through Nature, to Eternity
704       
705          Ham. I Madam, it is common
706       
707          Queen. If it be;
708       Why seemes it so particular with thee
709       
710          Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
711       'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
712       Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
713       Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
714       No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
715       Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
716       Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
717       That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
718       For they are actions that a man might play:
719       But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
720       These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe
721       
722          King. 'Tis sweet and commendable
723       In your Nature Hamlet,
724       To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
725       But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
726       That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
727       In filiall Obligation, for some terme
728       To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
729       In obstinate Condolement, is a course
730       Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
731       It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
732       A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
733       An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
734       For, what we know must be, and is as common
735       As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
736       Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
737       Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
738       A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
739       To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
740       Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
741       From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
742       This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
743       This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
744       As of a Father; For let the world take note,
745       You are the most immediate to our Throne,
746       And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
747       Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
748       Do I impart towards you. For your intent
749       In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
750       It is most retrograde to our desire:
751       And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
752       Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
753       Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne
754       
755          Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
756       I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg
757       
758          Ham. I shall in all my best
759       Obey you Madam
760       
761          King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
762       Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
763       This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
764       Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
765       No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
766       But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
767       And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
768       Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.
769       
770       Exeunt.
771       
772       Manet Hamlet.
773       
774         Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
775       Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
776       Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
777       His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
778       How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
779       Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
780       Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
781       That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
782       Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
783       But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
784       So excellent a King, that was to this
785       Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
786       That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
787       Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
788       Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
789       As if encrease of Appetite had growne
790       By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
791       Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
792       A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
793       With which she followed my poore Fathers body
794       Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.
795       (O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
796       Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
797       My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
798       Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?
799       Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
800       Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
801       She married. O most wicked speed, to post
802       With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
803       It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
804       But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
805       Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.
806       
807         Hor. Haile to your Lordship
808       
809          Ham. I am glad to see you well:
810       Horatio, or I do forget my selfe
811       
812          Hor. The same my Lord,
813       And your poore Seruant euer
814       
815          Ham. Sir my good friend,
816       Ile change that name with you:
817       And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
818       Marcellus
819       
820          Mar. My good Lord
821       
822          Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
823       But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
824         Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord
825       
826          Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;
827       Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
828       To make it truster of your owne report
829       Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
830       But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
831       Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart
832       
833          Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall
834       
835          Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)
836       I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding
837       
838          Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon
839       
840          Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats
841       Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
842       Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
843       Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
844       My father, me thinkes I see my father
845       
846          Hor. Oh where my Lord?
847         Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)
848         Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King
849       
850          Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:
851       I shall not look vpon his like againe
852       
853          Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight
854       
855          Ham. Saw? Who?
856         Hor. My Lord, the King your Father
857       
858          Ham. The King my Father?
859         Hor. Season your admiration for a while
860       With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
861       Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
862       This maruell to you
863       
864          Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare
865       
866          Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
867       (Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch
868       In the dead wast and middle of the night
869       Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
870       Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
871       Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
872       Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
873       By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
874       Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
875       Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
876       Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
877       In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
878       And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
879       Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
880       Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
881       The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
882       These hands are not more like
883       
884          Ham. But where was this?
885         Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht
886       
887          Ham. Did you not speake to it?
888         Hor. My Lord, I did;
889       But answere made it none: yet once me thought
890       It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
891       It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
892       But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
893       And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
894       And vanisht from our sight
895       
896          Ham. Tis very strange
897       
898          Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
899       And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
900       To let you know of it
901       
902          Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
903       Hold you the watch to Night?
904         Both. We doe my Lord
905       
906          Ham. Arm'd, say you?
907         Both. Arm'd, my Lord
908       
909          Ham. From top to toe?
910         Both. My Lord, from head to foote
911       
912          Ham. Then saw you not his face?
913         Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp
914       
915          Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?
916         Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger
917       
918          Ham. Pale, or red?
919         Hor. Nay very pale
920       
921          Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?
922         Hor. Most constantly
923       
924          Ham. I would I had beene there
925       
926          Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you
927       
928          Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?
929         Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred
930       
931          All. Longer, longer
932       
933          Hor. Not when I saw't
934       
935          Ham. His Beard was grisly? no
936       
937          Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
938       A Sable Siluer'd
939       
940          Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe
941       
942          Hor. I warrant you it will
943       
944          Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,
945       Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
946       And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
947       If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
948       Let it bee treble in your silence still:
949       And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
950       Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
951       I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:
952       Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
953       Ile visit you
954       
955          All. Our duty to your Honour.
956       
957       Exeunt
958       
959          Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
960       My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
961       I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
962       Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
963       Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
964       Enter.
965       
966       
967       Scena Tertia
968       
969       
970       Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
971       
972         Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
973       And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
974       And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
975       But let me heare from you
976       
977          Ophel. Doe you doubt that?
978         Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,
979       Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;
980       A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
981       Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
982       The suppliance of a minute? No more
983       
984          Ophel. No more but so
985       
986          Laer. Thinke it no more:
987       For nature cressant does not grow alone,
988       In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
989       The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
990       Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
991       And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
992       The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
993       His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
994       For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
995       Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
996       Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
997       The sanctity and health of the whole State.
998       And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
999       Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
1000      Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
1001      It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
1002      As he in his peculiar Sect and force
1003      May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
1004      Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
1005      Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,
1006      If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
1007      Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
1008      To his vnmastred importunity.
1009      Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
1010      And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
1011      Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
1012      The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
1013      If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
1014      Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
1015      The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
1016      Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
1017      And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
1018      Contagious blastments are most imminent.
1019      Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
1020      Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere
1021      
1022         Ophe. I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe,
1023      As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother
1024      Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
1025      Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
1026      Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
1027      Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
1028      And reaks not his owne reade
1029      
1030         Laer. Oh, feare me not.
1031      Enter Polonius.
1032      
1033      I stay too long; but here my Father comes:
1034      A double blessing is a double grace;
1035      Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue
1036      
1037         Polon. Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,
1038      The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
1039      And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
1040      And these few Precepts in thy memory,
1041      See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
1042      Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act:
1043      Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:
1044      The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,
1045      Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
1046      But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
1047      Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
1048      Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
1049      Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
1050      Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
1051      Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
1052      Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
1053      But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
1054      For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
1055      And they in France of the best ranck and station,
1056      Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
1057      Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
1058      For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
1059      And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
1060      This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
1061      And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
1062      Thou canst not then be false to any man.
1063      Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee
1064      
1065         Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord
1066      
1067         Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend
1068      
1069         Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
1070      What I haue said to you
1071      
1072         Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,
1073      And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it
1074      
1075         Laer. Farewell.
1076      
1077      Exit Laer.
1078      
1079        Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?
1080        Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet
1081      
1082         Polon. Marry, well bethought:
1083      Tis told me he hath very oft of late
1084      Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
1085      Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
1086      If it be so, as so tis put on me;
1087      And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
1088      You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
1089      As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
1090      What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
1091        Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
1092      Of his affection to me
1093      
1094         Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
1095      Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
1096      Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
1097        Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke
1098      
1099         Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
1100      That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
1101      Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
1102      Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
1103      Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole
1104      
1105         Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
1106      In honourable fashion
1107      
1108         Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too
1109      
1110         Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
1111      My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen
1112      
1113         Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
1114      When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
1115      Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
1116      Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
1117      Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
1118      You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
1119      Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
1120      Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
1121      Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
1122      Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
1123      And with a larger tether may he walke,
1124      Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,
1125      Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
1126      Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
1127      But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
1128      Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
1129      The better to beguile. This is for all:
1130      I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
1131      Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
1132      As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
1133      Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes
1134      
1135         Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.
1136      
1137      Exeunt.
1138      
1139      Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.
1140      
1141        Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
1142        Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre
1143      
1144         Ham. What hower now?
1145        Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue
1146      
1147         Mar. No, it is strooke
1148      
1149         Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
1150      Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
1151      What does this meane my Lord?
1152        Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,
1153      Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
1154      And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
1155      The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
1156      The triumph of his Pledge
1157      
1158         Horat. Is it a custome?
1159        Ham. I marry ist;
1160      And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
1161      And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
1162      More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
1163      Enter Ghost.
1164      
1165        Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes
1166      
1167         Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
1168      Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
1169      Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,
1170      Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
1171      Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
1172      That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,
1173      King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
1174      Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
1175      Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
1176      Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
1177      Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
1178      Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
1179      To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
1180      That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
1181      Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
1182      Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
1183      So horridly to shake our disposition,
1184      With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
1185      Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?
1186      
1187      Ghost beckens Hamlet.
1188      
1189        Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,
1190      As if it some impartment did desire
1191      To you alone
1192      
1193         Mar. Looke with what courteous action
1194      It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
1195      But doe not goe with it
1196      
1197         Hor. No, by no meanes
1198      
1199         Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it
1200      
1201         Hor. Doe not my Lord
1202      
1203         Ham. Why, what should be the feare?
1204      I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
1205      And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
1206      Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
1207      It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it
1208      
1209         Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
1210      Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
1211      That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
1212      And there assumes some other horrible forme,
1213      Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
1214      And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
1215        Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee
1216      
1217         Mar. You shall not goe my Lord
1218      
1219         Ham. Hold off your hand
1220      
1221         Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe
1222      
1223         Ham. My fate cries out,
1224      And makes each petty Artire in this body,
1225      As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
1226      Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
1227      By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
1228      I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
1229      
1230      Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.
1231      
1232        Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination
1233      
1234         Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him
1235      
1236         Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?
1237        Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke
1238      
1239         Hor. Heauen will direct it
1240      
1241         Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
1242      
1243      Exeunt.
1244      
1245      Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
1246      
1247        Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further
1248      
1249         Gho. Marke me
1250      
1251         Ham. I will
1252      
1253         Gho. My hower is almost come,
1254      When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
1255      Must render vp my selfe
1256      
1257         Ham. Alas poore Ghost
1258      
1259         Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
1260      To what I shall vnfold
1261      
1262         Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare
1263      
1264         Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare
1265      
1266         Ham. What?
1267        Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,
1268      Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
1269      And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
1270      Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
1271      Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
1272      To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;
1273      I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
1274      Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
1275      Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
1276      Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
1277      And each particular haire to stand an end,
1278      Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
1279      But this eternall blason must not be
1280      To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,
1281      If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue
1282      
1283         Ham. Oh Heauen!
1284        Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther
1285      
1286         Ham. Murther?
1287        Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
1288      But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall
1289      
1290         Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,
1291      That with wings as swift
1292      As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
1293      May sweepe to my Reuenge
1294      
1295         Ghost. I finde thee apt,
1296      And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
1297      That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
1298      Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:
1299      It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
1300      A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
1301      Is by a forged processe of my death
1302      Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
1303      The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
1304      Now weares his Crowne
1305      
1306         Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
1307        Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
1308      With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
1309      Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
1310      So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust
1311      The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
1312      Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
1313      From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
1314      That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
1315      I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
1316      Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
1317      To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
1318      Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
1319      So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
1320      Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
1321      But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
1322      Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
1323      My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
1324      Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
1325      With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
1326      And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
1327      The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
1328      Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
1329      That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
1330      The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;
1331      And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
1332      And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
1333      The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
1334      And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
1335      Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
1336      All my smooth Body.
1337      Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
1338      Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
1339      Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
1340      Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
1341      No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1342      With all my imperfections on my head;
1343      Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
1344      If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
1345      Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
1346      A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
1347      But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
1348      Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
1349      Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
1350      And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
1351      To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
1352      The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
1353      And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
1354      Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
1355      Enter.
1356      
1357        Ham. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
1358      And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
1359      And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
1360      But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
1361      I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
1362      In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
1363      Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
1364      Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
1365      All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
1366      That youth and obseruation coppied there;
1367      And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
1368      Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
1369      Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:
1370      Oh most pernicious woman!
1371      Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
1372      My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
1373      That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
1374      At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
1375      So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
1376      It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't
1377      
1378         Hor. & Mar. within. My Lord, my Lord.
1379      Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
1380      
1381        Mar. Lord Hamlet
1382      
1383         Hor. Heauen secure him
1384      
1385         Mar. So be it
1386      
1387         Hor. Illo, ho, ho, my Lord
1388      
1389         Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come
1390      
1391         Mar. How ist my Noble Lord?
1392        Hor. What newes, my Lord?
1393        Ham. Oh wonderfull!
1394        Hor. Good my Lord tell it
1395      
1396         Ham. No you'l reueale it
1397      
1398         Hor. Not I, my Lord, by Heauen
1399      
1400         Mar. Nor I, my Lord
1401      
1402         Ham. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
1403      But you'l be secret?
1404        Both. I, by Heau'n, my Lord
1405      
1406         Ham. There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
1407      But hee's an arrant knaue
1408      
1409         Hor. There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
1410      Graue, to tell vs this
1411      
1412         Ham. Why right, you are i'th' right;
1413      And so, without more circumstance at all,
1414      I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
1415      You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
1416      For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
1417      Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
1418      Looke you, Ile goe pray
1419      
1420         Hor. These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord
1421      
1422         Ham. I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
1423      Yes faith, heartily
1424      
1425         Hor. There's no offence my Lord
1426      
1427         Ham. Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,
1428      And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
1429      It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
1430      For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
1431      O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,
1432      As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
1433      Giue me one poore request
1434      
1435         Hor. What is't my Lord? we will
1436      
1437         Ham. Neuer make known what you haue seen to night
1438      
1439         Both. My Lord, we will not
1440      
1441         Ham. Nay, but swear't
1442      
1443         Hor. Infaith my Lord, not I
1444      
1445         Mar. Nor I my Lord: in faith
1446      
1447         Ham. Vpon my sword
1448      
1449         Marcell. We haue sworne my Lord already
1450      
1451         Ham. Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed
1452      
1453         Gho. Sweare.
1454      
1455      Ghost cries vnder the Stage.
1456      
1457        Ham. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny?
1458      Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
1459      Consent to sweare
1460      
1461         Hor. Propose the Oath my Lord
1462      
1463         Ham. Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
1464      Sweare by my sword
1465      
1466         Gho. Sweare
1467      
1468         Ham. Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
1469      Come hither Gentlemen,
1470      And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
1471      Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:
1472      Sweare by my Sword
1473      
1474         Gho. Sweare
1475      
1476         Ham. Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
1477      A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends
1478      
1479         Hor. Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange
1480      
1481         Ham. And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
1482      There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,
1483      Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,
1484      Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
1485      How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
1486      (As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
1487      To put an Anticke disposition on:)
1488      That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
1489      With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
1490      Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
1491      As well, we know, or we could and if we would,
1492      Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
1493      Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
1494      That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
1495      So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:
1496      Sweare
1497      
1498         Ghost. Sweare
1499      
1500         Ham. Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
1501      With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
1502      And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
1503      May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
1504      God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
1505      And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
1506      The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
1507      That euer I was borne to set it right.
1508      Nay, come let's goe together.
1509      
1510      Exeunt.

1514      
1515      Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo.
1516      
1517        Polon. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo
1518      
1519         Reynol. I will my Lord
1520      
1521         Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,
1522      Before you visite him you make inquiry
1523      Of his behauiour
1524      
1525         Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it
1526      
1527         Polon. Marry, well said;
1528      Very well said. Looke you Sir,
1529      Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
1530      And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
1531      What company, at what expence: and finding
1532      By this encompassement and drift of question,
1533      That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
1534      Then your particular demands will touch it,
1535      Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
1536      And thus I know his father and his friends,
1537      And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
1538        Reynol. I, very well my Lord
1539      
1540         Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;
1541      But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
1542      Addicted so and so; and there put on him
1543      What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,
1544      As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
1545      But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
1546      As are Companions noted and most knowne
1547      To youth and liberty
1548      
1549         Reynol. As gaming my Lord
1550      
1551         Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
1552      Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre
1553      
1554         Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him
1555      
1556         Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
1557      You must not put another scandall on him,
1558      That hee is open to Incontinencie;
1559      That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
1560      That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
1561      The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
1562      A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault
1563      
1564         Reynol. But my good Lord
1565      
1566         Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?
1567        Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that
1568      
1569         Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
1570      And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
1571      You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
1572      As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
1573      Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,
1574      Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
1575      The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
1576      He closes with you in this consequence:
1577      Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
1578      According to the Phrase and the Addition,
1579      Of man and Country
1580      
1581         Reynol. Very good my Lord
1582      
1583         Polon. And then Sir does he this?
1584      He does: what was I about to say?
1585      I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
1586        Reynol. At closes in the consequence:
1587      At friend, or so, and Gentleman
1588      
1589         Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,
1590      He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
1591      I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
1592      Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
1593      There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
1594      There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
1595      I saw him enter such a house of saile;
1596      Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;
1597      Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
1598      And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
1599      With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
1600      By indirections finde directions out:
1601      So by my former Lecture and aduice
1602      Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
1603        Reynol. My Lord I haue
1604      
1605         Polon. God buy you; fare you well
1606      
1607         Reynol. Good my Lord
1608      
1609         Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe
1610      
1611         Reynol. I shall my Lord
1612      
1613         Polon. And let him plye his Musicke
1614      
1615         Reynol. Well, my Lord.
1616      Enter.
1617      
1618      Enter Ophelia.
1619      
1620        Polon. Farewell:
1621      How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
1622        Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted
1623      
1624         Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?
1625        Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
1626      Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
1627      No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
1628      Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
1629      Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
1630      And with a looke so pitious in purport,
1631      As if he had been loosed out of hell,
1632      To speake of horrors: he comes before me
1633      
1634         Polon. Mad for thy Loue?
1635        Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it
1636      
1637         Polon. What said he?
1638        Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
1639      Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
1640      And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
1641      He fals to such perusall of my face,
1642      As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
1643      At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
1644      And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
1645      He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
1646      That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
1647      And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
1648      And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
1649      He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
1650      For out adores he went without their helpe;
1651      And to the last, bended their light on me
1652      
1653         Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
1654      This is the very extasie of Loue,
1655      Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
1656      And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
1657      As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
1658      That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
1659      What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
1660        Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,
1661      I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
1662      His accesse to me
1663      
1664         Pol. That hath made him mad.
1665      I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
1666      I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
1667      And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
1668      It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
1669      To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
1670      As it is common for the yonger sort
1671      To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
1672      This must be knowne, being kept close might moue
1673      More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.
1674      
1675      Exeunt.
1676      
1677      
1678      Scena Secunda.
1679      
1680      Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.
1681      
1682        King. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
1683      Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
1684      The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
1685      Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard
1686      Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
1687      Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
1688      Resembles that it was. What it should bee
1689      More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
1690      So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
1691      I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
1692      That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
1693      And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
1694      That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
1695      Some little time: so by your Companies
1696      To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
1697      So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
1698      That open'd lies within our remedie
1699      
1700         Qu. Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1701      And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
1702      To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1703      To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,
1704      As to expend your time with vs a-while,
1705      For the supply and profit of our Hope,
1706      Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
1707      As fits a Kings remembrance
1708      
1709         Rosin. Both your Maiesties
1710      Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
1711      Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
1712      Then to Entreatie
1713      
1714         Guil. We both obey,
1715      And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
1716      To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
1717      To be commanded
1718      
1719         King. Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne
1720      
1721         Qu. Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
1722      And I beseech you instantly to visit
1723      My too much changed Sonne.
1724      Go some of ye,
1725      And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is
1726      
1727         Guil. Heauens make our presence and our practises
1728      Pleasant and helpfull to him.
1729      Enter.
1730      
1731        Queene. Amen.
1732      Enter Polonius.
1733      
1734        Pol. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
1735      Are ioyfully return'd
1736      
1737         King. Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes
1738      
1739         Pol. Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,
1740      I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
1741      Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
1742      And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
1743      Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
1744      As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
1745      The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie
1746      
1747         King. Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare
1748      
1749         Pol. Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
1750      My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast
1751      
1752         King. Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
1753      He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
1754      The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper
1755      
1756         Qu. I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
1757      His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.
1758      Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.
1759      
1760        King. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:
1761      Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?
1762        Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
1763      Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
1764      His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
1765      To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
1766      But better look'd into, he truly found
1767      It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
1768      That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
1769      Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
1770      On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
1771      Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
1772      Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
1773      To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
1774      Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
1775      Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
1776      And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
1777      So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
1778      With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
1779      That it might please you to giue quiet passe
1780      Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
1781      On such regards of safety and allowance,
1782      As therein are set downe
1783      
1784         King. It likes vs well:
1785      And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
1786      Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
1787      Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
1788      Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
1789      Most welcome home.
1790      
1791      Exit Ambass.
1792      
1793        Pol. This businesse is very well ended.
1794      My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
1795      What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
1796      Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
1797      Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
1798      Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
1799      And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
1800      I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
1801      Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
1802      What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
1803      But let that go
1804      
1805         Qu. More matter, with lesse Art
1806      
1807         Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
1808      That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
1809      And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
1810      But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
1811      Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
1812      That we finde out the cause of this effect,
1813      Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
1814      For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
1815      Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
1816      I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
1817      Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
1818      Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.
1819      
1820      The Letter.
1821      
1822      To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.
1823      That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
1824      Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white
1825      bosome, these
1826      
1827         Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her
1828      
1829         Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
1830      Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
1831      Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
1832      Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
1833      But neuer Doubt, I loue.
1834      O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to
1835      reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue
1836      it. Adieu.
1837      Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
1838      Machine is to him, Hamlet.
1839      This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
1840      And more aboue hath his soliciting,
1841      As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
1842      All giuen to mine eare
1843      
1844         King. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
1845        Pol. What do you thinke of me?
1846        King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable
1847      
1848         Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?
1849      When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
1850      As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
1851      Before my Daughter told me what might you
1852      Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
1853      If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
1854      Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
1855      Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
1856      What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
1857      And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
1858      Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,
1859      This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
1860      That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
1861      Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
1862      Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
1863      And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
1864      Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
1865      Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
1866      Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
1867      Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
1868      And all we waile for
1869      
1870         King. Do you thinke 'tis this?
1871        Qu. It may be very likely
1872      
1873         Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
1874      That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
1875      When it prou'd otherwise?
1876        King. Not that I know
1877      
1878         Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
1879      If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
1880      Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
1881      Within the Center
1882      
1883         King. How may we try it further?
1884        Pol. You know sometimes
1885      He walkes foure houres together, heere
1886      In the Lobby
1887      
1888         Qu. So he ha's indeed
1889      
1890         Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
1891      Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
1892      Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
1893      And be not from his reason falne thereon;
1894      Let me be no Assistant for a State,
1895      And keepe a Farme and Carters
1896      
1897         King. We will try it.
1898      Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.
1899      
1900        Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretch
1901      Comes reading
1902      
1903         Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,
1904      Ile boord him presently.
1905      
1906      Exit King & Queen.
1907      
1908      Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?
1909        Ham. Well, God-a-mercy
1910      
1911         Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?
1912        Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger
1913      
1914         Pol. Not I my Lord
1915      
1916         Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man
1917      
1918         Pol. Honest, my Lord?
1919        Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
1920      one man pick'd out of two thousand
1921      
1922         Pol. That's very true, my Lord
1923      
1924         Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
1925      being a good kissing Carrion-
1926      Haue you a daughter?
1927        Pol. I haue my Lord
1928      
1929         Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a
1930      blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend
1931      looke too't
1932      
1933         Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:
1934      yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
1935      he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
1936      I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
1937      speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?
1938        Ham. Words, words, words
1939      
1940         Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?
1941        Ham. Betweene who?
1942        Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord
1943      
1944         Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
1945      that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
1946      their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
1947      Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
1948      together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I
1949      most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
1950      not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
1951      selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
1952      go backward
1953      
1954         Pol. Though this be madnesse,
1955      Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
1956      Out of the ayre my Lord?
1957        Ham. Into my Graue?
1958        Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:
1959      How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
1960      A happinesse,
1961      That often Madnesse hits on,
1962      Which Reason and Sanitie could not
1963      So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
1964      I will leaue him,
1965      And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
1966      Betweene him, and my daughter.
1967      My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly
1968      Take my leaue of you
1969      
1970         Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
1971      will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
1972      life
1973      
1974         Polon. Fare you well my Lord
1975      
1976         Ham. These tedious old fooles
1977      
1978         Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there
1979      hee is.
1980      Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.
1981      
1982        Rosin. God saue you Sir
1983      
1984         Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?
1985        Rosin. My most deare Lord?
1986        Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou
1987      Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye
1988      both?
1989        Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth
1990      
1991         Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes
1992      Cap, we are not the very Button
1993      
1994         Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
1995        Rosin. Neither my Lord
1996      
1997         Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle
1998      of her fauour?
1999        Guil. Faith, her priuates, we
2000      
2001         Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:
2002      she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?
2003        Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne
2004      honest
2005      
2006         Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is
2007      not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue
2008      you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
2009      that she sends you to Prison hither?
2010        Guil. Prison, my Lord?
2011        Ham. Denmark's a Prison
2012      
2013         Rosin. Then is the World one
2014      
2015         Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
2016      Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
2017      worst
2018      
2019         Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord
2020      
2021         Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
2022      either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
2023      a prison
2024      
2025         Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
2026      too narrow for your minde
2027      
2028         Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
2029      count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
2030      I haue bad dreames
2031      
2032         Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
2033      very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
2034      of a Dreame
2035      
2036         Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow
2037      
2038         Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
2039      light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow
2040      
2041         Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs
2042      and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
2043      shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
2044        Both. Wee'l wait vpon you
2045      
2046         Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the
2047      rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
2048      man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
2049      way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?
2050        Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion
2051      
2052         Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
2053      but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
2054      are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it
2055      your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
2056      deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake
2057      
2058         Guil. What should we say my Lord?
2059        Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were
2060      sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
2061      which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
2062      I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you
2063      
2064         Rosin. To what end my Lord?
2065        Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
2066      you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
2067      our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,
2068      and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
2069      you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
2070      were sent for or no
2071      
2072         Rosin. What say you?
2073        Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me
2074      hold not off
2075      
2076         Guil. My Lord, we were sent for
2077      
2078         Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
2079      preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
2080      Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
2081      I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
2082      and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;
2083      that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
2084      Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
2085      look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
2086      fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
2087      to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.
2088      What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in
2089      Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing
2090      how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?
2091      in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the
2092      world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
2093      this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,
2094      nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
2095      to say so
2096      
2097         Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
2098      thoughts
2099      
2100         Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
2101      not me?
2102        Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
2103      what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
2104      from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
2105      they comming to offer you Seruice
2106      
2107         Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
2108      Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
2109      Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
2110      not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
2111      peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
2112      are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
2113      freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
2114      are they?
2115        Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in
2116      the Tragedians of the City
2117      
2118         Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence
2119      both in reputation and profit was better both
2120      wayes
2121      
2122         Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
2123      of the late Innouation?
2124        Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did
2125      when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?
2126        Rosin. No indeed, they are not
2127      
2128         Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?
2129        Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
2130      pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
2131      Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
2132      are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
2133      fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
2134      call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
2135      Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither
2136      
2137         Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?
2138      How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no
2139      longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
2140      if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
2141      it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
2142      do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
2143      owne Succession
2144      
2145         Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
2146      and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.
2147      There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,
2148      vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
2149      the Question
2150      
2151         Ham. Is't possible?
2152        Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of
2153      Braines
2154      
2155         Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?
2156        Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too
2157      
2158         Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
2159      Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
2160      while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
2161      Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something
2162      in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
2163      finde it out.
2164      
2165      Flourish for the Players.
2166      
2167        Guil. There are the Players
2168      
2169         Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
2170      hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
2171      and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
2172      lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
2173      fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
2174      then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
2175      and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd
2176      
2177         Guil. In what my deere Lord?
2178        Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the
2179      Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
2180      Enter Polonius.
2181      
2182        Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen
2183      
2184         Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
2185      eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
2186      out of his swathing clouts
2187      
2188         Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for
2189      they say, an old man is twice a childe
2190      
2191         Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the
2192      Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
2193      'twas so indeed
2194      
2195         Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you
2196      
2197         Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
2198      When Rossius an Actor in Rome-
2199        Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord
2200      
2201         Ham. Buzze, buzze
2202      
2203         Pol. Vpon mine Honor
2204      
2205         Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-
2206        Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
2207      Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
2208      Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
2209      Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
2210      Scene indiuidible: or Poem
2211      vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus
2212      too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are
2213      the onely men
2214      
2215         Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st
2216      thou?
2217        Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
2218        Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,
2219      The which he loued passing well
2220      
2221         Pol. Still on my Daughter
2222      
2223         Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
2224        Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter
2225      that I loue passing well
2226      
2227         Ham. Nay that followes not
2228      
2229         Polon. What followes then, my Lord?
2230        Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It
2231      came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
2232      Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my
2233      Abridgements come.
2234      Enter foure or fiue Players.
2235      
2236      Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see
2237      thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?
2238      Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
2239      beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
2240      Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
2241      I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
2242      your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
2243      within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
2244      to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
2245      haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:
2246      come, a passionate speech
2247      
2248         1.Play. What speech, my Lord?
2249        Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
2250      neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
2251      remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
2252      Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
2253      iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
2254      excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
2255      with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,
2256      there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;
2257      nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
2258      Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One
2259      cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
2260      to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
2261      of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at
2262      this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like
2263      th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
2264      The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
2265      Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
2266      When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
2267      Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
2268      With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
2269      Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
2270      With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
2271      Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
2272      That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
2273      To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
2274      And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
2275      With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
2276      Olde Grandsire Priam seekes
2277      
2278         Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,
2279      and good discretion
2280      
2281         1.Player. Anon he findes him,
2282      Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,
2283      Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
2284      Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
2285      Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:
2286      But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
2287      Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,
2288      Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
2289      Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
2290      Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword
2291      Which was declining on the Milkie head
2292      Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
2293      So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
2294      And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
2295      But as we often see against some storme,
2296      A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
2297      The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
2298      As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
2299      Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,
2300      A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
2301      And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
2302      On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
2303      With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword
2304      Now falles on Priam.
2305      Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,
2306      In generall Synod take away her power:
2307      Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
2308      And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
2309      As low as to the Fiends
2310      
2311         Pol. This is too long
2312      
2313         Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee
2314      say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
2315      sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba
2316      
2317         1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen
2318      
2319         Ham. The inobled Queene?
2320        Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good
2321      
2322         1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,
2323      Threatning the flame
2324      With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
2325      Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
2326      About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
2327      A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
2328      Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
2329      'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
2330      But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
2331      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
2332      In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
2333      The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
2334      (Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)
2335      Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
2336      And passion in the Gods
2337      
2338         Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and
2339      ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more
2340      
2341         Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
2342      soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.
2343      Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
2344      the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After
2345      your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
2346      their ill report while you liued
2347      
2348         Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart
2349      
2350         Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man
2351      after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
2352      them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they
2353      deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them
2354      in
2355      
2356         Pol. Come sirs.
2357      
2358      Exit Polon.
2359      
2360        Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
2361      Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the
2362      murther of Gonzago?
2363        Play. I my Lord
2364      
2365         Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a
2366      need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
2367      I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?
2368        Play. I my Lord
2369      
2370         Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you
2371      mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night
2372      you are welcome to Elsonower?
2373        Rosin. Good my Lord.
2374      
2375      Exeunt.
2376      
2377      Manet Hamlet.
2378      
2379        Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
2380      Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
2381      Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
2382      But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
2383      Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
2384      That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
2385      Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
2386      A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
2387      With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?
2388      For Hecuba?
2389      What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
2390      That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,
2391      Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
2392      That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,
2393      And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
2394      Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
2395      Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
2396      The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
2397      A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake
2398      Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
2399      And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
2400      Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
2401      A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?
2402      Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?
2403      Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
2404      Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,
2405      As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
2406      Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
2407      But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
2408      To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
2409      I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
2410      With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,
2411      Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
2412      Oh Vengeance!
2413      Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,
2414      That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,
2415      Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,
2416      Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
2417      And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
2418      A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.
2419      I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
2420      Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,
2421      Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently
2422      They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
2423      For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake
2424      With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,
2425      Play something like the murder of my Father,
2426      Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,
2427      Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench
2428      I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
2429      May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power
2430      T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
2431      Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
2432      As he is very potent with such Spirits,
2433      Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds
2434      More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,
2435      Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.
2436      
2437      Exit
2438      
2439      Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
2440      Guildenstern, and
2441      Lords.
2442      
2443        King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
2444      Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
2445      Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
2446      With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy
2447      
2448         Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
2449      But from what cause he will by no meanes speake
2450      
2451         Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
2452      But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
2453      When we would bring him on to some Confession
2454      Of his true state
2455      
2456         Qu. Did he receiue you well?
2457        Rosin. Most like a Gentleman
2458      
2459         Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition
2460      
2461         Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands
2462      Most free in his reply
2463      
2464         Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?
2465        Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
2466      We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,
2467      And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
2468      To heare of it: They are about the Court,
2469      And (as I thinke) they haue already order
2470      This night to play before him
2471      
2472         Pol. 'Tis most true:
2473      And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
2474      To heare, and see the matter
2475      
2476         King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
2477      To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,
2478      Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on
2479      To these delights
2480      
2481         Rosin. We shall my Lord.
2482      
2483      Exeunt.
2484      
2485        King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,
2486      For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,
2487      That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
2488      Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)
2489      Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
2490      We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
2491      And gather by him, as he is behaued,
2492      If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
2493      That thus he suffers for
2494      
2495         Qu. I shall obey you,
2496      And for your part Ophelia, I do wish
2497      That your good Beauties be the happy cause
2498      Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
2499      Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
2500      To both your Honors
2501      
2502         Ophe. Madam, I wish it may
2503      
2504         Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
2505      We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
2506      That shew of such an exercise may colour
2507      Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,
2508      'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
2509      And pious Action, we do surge o're
2510      The diuell himselfe
2511      
2512         King. Oh 'tis true:
2513      How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
2514      The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art
2515      Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
2516      Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
2517      Oh heauie burthen!
2518        Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.
2519      
2520      Exeunt.
2521      
2522      Enter Hamlet.
2523      
2524        Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
2525      Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
2526      The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
2527      Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
2528      And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
2529      No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
2530      The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
2531      That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
2532      Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
2533      To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,
2534      For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
2535      When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,
2536      Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
2537      That makes Calamity of so long life:
2538      For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
2539      The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
2540      The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
2541      The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
2542      That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
2543      When he himselfe might his Quietus make
2544      With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
2545      To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
2546      But that the dread of something after death,
2547      The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
2548      No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
2549      And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
2550      Then flye to others that we know not of.
2551      Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
2552      And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
2553      Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
2554      And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
2555      With this regard their Currants turne away,
2556      And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
2557      The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons
2558      Be all my sinnes remembred
2559      
2560         Ophe. Good my Lord,
2561      How does your Honor for this many a day?
2562        Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well
2563      
2564         Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
2565      That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
2566      I pray you now, receiue them
2567      
2568         Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought
2569      
2570         Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
2571      And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
2572      As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
2573      Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
2574      Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
2575      There my Lord
2576      
2577         Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?
2578        Ophe. My Lord
2579      
2580         Ham. Are you faire?
2581        Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?
2582        Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
2583      should admit no discourse to your Beautie
2584      
2585         Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
2586      then your Honestie?
2587        Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
2588      transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
2589      force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
2590      This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
2591      proofe. I did loue you once
2592      
2593         Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so
2594      
2595         Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
2596      cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
2597      of it. I loued you not
2598      
2599         Ophe. I was the more deceiued
2600      
2601         Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou
2602      be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
2603      but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
2604      my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,
2605      Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
2606      then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
2607      them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such
2608      Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
2609      We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
2610      wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?
2611        Ophe. At home, my Lord
2612      
2613         Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
2614      play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell
2615      
2616         Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens
2617      
2618         Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
2619      for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
2620      thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
2621      Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
2622      for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
2623      make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell
2624      
2625         Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him
2626      
2627         Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
2628      God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:
2629      you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
2630      Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.
2631      Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
2632      I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
2633      married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
2634      as they are. To a Nunnery, go.
2635      
2636      Exit Hamlet.
2637      
2638        Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
2639      The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
2640      Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
2641      The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
2642      Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
2643      Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
2644      That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
2645      Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
2646      Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
2647      That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
2648      Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
2649      T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
2650      Enter King, and Polonius.
2651      
2652        King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
2653      Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
2654      Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
2655      O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
2656      And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
2657      Will be some danger, which to preuent
2658      I haue in quicke determination
2659      Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
2660      For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
2661      Haply the Seas and Countries different
2662      With variable Obiects, shall expell
2663      This something setled matter in his heart:
2664      Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
2665      From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?
2666        Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
2667      The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
2668      Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?
2669      You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
2670      We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
2671      But if you hold it fit after the Play,
2672      Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
2673      To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
2674      And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
2675      Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
2676      To England send him: Or confine him where
2677      Your wisedome best shall thinke
2678      
2679         King. It shall be so:
2680      Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.
2681      
2682      Exeunt.
2683      
2684      Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.
2685      
2686        Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
2687      it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
2688      as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
2689      had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
2690      your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
2691      Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
2692      Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
2693      may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,
2694      to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
2695      to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
2696      Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
2697      nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
2698      haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
2699      outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it
2700      
2701         Player. I warrant your Honor
2702      
2703         Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
2704      Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,
2705      the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
2706      That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
2707      thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
2708      end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
2709      the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
2710      Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
2711      Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this
2712      ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull
2713      laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
2714      censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway
2715      a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players
2716      that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
2717      highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
2718      the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
2719      or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
2720      thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,
2721      and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably
2722      
2723         Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
2724      vs, Sir
2725      
2726         Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that
2727      play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
2728      them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
2729      to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
2730      too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
2731      of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
2732      shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
2733      it. Go make you readie.
2734      
2735      Exit Players.
2736      
2737      Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
2738      
2739      How now my Lord,
2740      Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
2741        Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently
2742      
2743         Ham. Bid the Players make hast.
2744      
2745      Exit Polonius.
2746      
2747      Will you two helpe to hasten them?
2748        Both. We will my Lord.
2749      
2750      Exeunt.
2751      
2752      Enter Horatio.
2753      
2754        Ham. What hoa, Horatio?
2755        Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice
2756      
2757         Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man
2758      As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall
2759      
2760         Hora. O my deere Lord
2761      
2762         Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
2763      For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
2764      That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
2765      To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
2766      No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
2767      And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
2768      Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
2769      Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
2770      And could of men distinguish, her election
2771      Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
2772      As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
2773      A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
2774      Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
2775      Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,
2776      That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
2777      To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
2778      That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
2779      In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,
2780      As I do thee. Something too much of this.
2781      There is a Play to night to before the King.
2782      One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
2783      Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
2784      I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
2785      Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
2786      Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
2787      Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
2788      It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
2789      And my Imaginations are as foule
2790      As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
2791      For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
2792      And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
2793      To censure of his seeming
2794      
2795         Hora. Well my Lord.
2796      If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
2797      And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
2798      Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
2799      Guildensterne, and
2800      other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish
2801      March. Sound
2802      a Flourish.
2803      
2804        Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
2805      Get you a place
2806      
2807         King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?
2808        Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
2809      the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so
2810      
2811         King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
2812      words are not mine
2813      
2814         Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once
2815      i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
2816        Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
2817      Actor
2818      
2819         Ham. And what did you enact?
2820        Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
2821      Brutus kill'd me
2822      
2823         Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
2824      Calfe there. Be the Players ready?
2825        Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience
2826      
2827         Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me
2828      
2829         Ha. No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue
2830      
2831         Pol. Oh ho, do you marke that?
2832        Ham. Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
2833        Ophe. No my Lord
2834      
2835         Ham. I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
2836        Ophe. I my Lord
2837      
2838         Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
2839        Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord
2840      
2841         Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs
2842        Ophe. What is my Lord?
2843        Ham. Nothing
2844      
2845         Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?
2846        Ham. Who I?
2847        Ophe. I my Lord
2848      
2849         Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should
2850      a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully
2851      my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
2852      Houres
2853      
2854         Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord
2855      
2856         Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
2857      for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths
2858      ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a
2859      great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:
2860      But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
2861      he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
2862      Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.
2863      
2864      Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters.
2865      
2866      Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing
2867      him. She
2868      kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her
2869      vp, and
2870      declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke
2871      of Flowers.
2872      She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,
2873      takes off his
2874      Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and
2875      Exits. The
2876      Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate
2877      Action. The
2878      Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming
2879      to lament
2880      with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the
2881      Queene with
2882      Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,
2883      accepts his
2884      loue.
2885      
2886      Exeunt.
2887      
2888        Ophe. What meanes this, my Lord?
2889        Ham. Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
2890      Mischeefe
2891      
2892         Ophe. Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
2893      Play?
2894        Ham. We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
2895      cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all
2896      
2897         Ophe. Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
2898        Ham. I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
2899      you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it
2900      meanes
2901      
2902         Ophe. You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
2903      Play.
2904      Enter Prologue.
2905      
2906      For vs, and for our Tragedie,
2907      Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
2908      We begge your hearing Patientlie
2909      
2910         Ham. Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
2911        Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord
2912      
2913         Ham. As Womans loue.
2914      Enter King and his Queene.
2915      
2916        King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
2917      Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:
2918      And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
2919      About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
2920      Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
2921      Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands
2922      
2923         Bap. So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
2924      Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
2925      But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
2926      So farre from cheere, and from your former state,
2927      That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
2928      Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:
2929      For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
2930      In neither ought, or in extremity:
2931      Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
2932      And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so
2933      
2934         King. Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
2935      My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
2936      And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
2937      Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
2938      For Husband shalt thou-
2939        Bap. Oh confound the rest:
2940      Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
2941      In second Husband, let me be accurst,
2942      None wed the second, but who kill'd the first
2943      
2944         Ham. Wormwood, Wormwood
2945      
2946         Bapt. The instances that second Marriage moue,
2947      Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
2948      A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
2949      When second Husband kisses me in Bed
2950      
2951         King. I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
2952      But what we do determine, oft we breake:
2953      Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
2954      Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
2955      Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
2956      But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
2957      Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
2958      To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
2959      What to our selues in passion we propose,
2960      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
2961      The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
2962      Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
2963      Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
2964      Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
2965      This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
2966      That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
2967      For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
2968      Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
2969      The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
2970      The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
2971      And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
2972      For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
2973      And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
2974      Directly seasons him his Enemie.
2975      But orderly to end, where I begun,
2976      Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
2977      That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
2978      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
2979      So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
2980      But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead
2981      
2982         Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
2983      Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
2984      Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
2985      Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
2986      Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
2987      If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife
2988      
2989         Ham. If she should breake it now
2990      
2991         King. 'Tis deepely sworne:
2992      Sweet, leaue me heere a while,
2993      My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
2994      The tedious day with sleepe
2995      
2996         Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,
2997      
2998      Sleepes
2999      
3000      And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.
3001      
3002      Exit
3003      
3004        Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?
3005        Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes
3006      
3007         Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word
3008      
3009         King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence
3010      in't?
3011        Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence
3012      i'th' world
3013      
3014         King. What do you call the Play?
3015        Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:
3016      This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
3017      is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
3018      anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
3019      Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
3020      vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
3021      Enter Lucianus.
3022      
3023      This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
3024      
3025         Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord
3026      
3027         Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
3028      if I could see the Puppets dallying
3029      
3030         Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene
3031      
3032         Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
3033      edge
3034      
3035         Ophe. Still better and worse
3036      
3037         Ham. So you mistake Husbands.
3038      Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
3039      begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge
3040      
3041         Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,
3042      Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
3043      Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
3044      Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
3045      With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
3046      Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
3047      On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.
3048      
3049      Powres the poyson in his eares.
3050      
3051        Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
3052      name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
3053      Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
3054      loue of Gonzago's wife
3055      
3056         Ophe. The King rises
3057      
3058         Ham. What, frighted with false fire
3059      
3060         Qu. How fares my Lord?
3061        Pol. Giue o're the Play
3062      
3063         King. Giue me some Light. Away
3064      
3065         All. Lights, Lights, Lights.
3066      
3067      Exeunt.
3068      
3069      Manet Hamlet & Horatio.
3070      
3071        Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,
3072      The Hart vngalled play:
3073      For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
3074      So runnes the world away.
3075      Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
3076      my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
3077      Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
3078      of Players sir
3079      
3080         Hor. Halfe a share
3081      
3082         Ham. A whole one I,
3083      For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,
3084      This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,
3085      And now reignes heere.
3086      A verie verie Paiocke
3087      
3088         Hora. You might haue Rim'd
3089      
3090         Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for
3091      a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?
3092        Hora. Verie well my Lord
3093      
3094         Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
3095        Hora. I did verie well note him.
3096      Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
3097      
3098        Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:
3099      For if the King like not the Comedie,
3100      Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
3101      Come some Musicke
3102      
3103         Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you
3104      
3105         Ham. Sir, a whole History
3106      
3107         Guild. The King, sir
3108      
3109         Ham. I sir, what of him?
3110        Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd
3111      
3112         Ham. With drinke Sir?
3113        Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller
3114      
3115         Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,
3116      to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him
3117      to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
3118      more Choller
3119      
3120         Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some
3121      frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre
3122      
3123         Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce
3124      
3125         Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction
3126      of spirit, hath sent me to you
3127      
3128         Ham. You are welcome
3129      
3130         Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
3131      the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome
3132      answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
3133      if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
3134      my Businesse
3135      
3136         Ham. Sir, I cannot
3137      
3138         Guild. What, my Lord?
3139        Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
3140      But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:
3141      or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
3142      but to the matter. My Mother you say
3143      
3144         Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke
3145      her into amazement, and admiration
3146      
3147         Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a
3148      Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers
3149      admiration?
3150        Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,
3151      ere you go to bed
3152      
3153         Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
3154      Haue you any further Trade with vs?
3155        Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me
3156      
3157         Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers
3158      
3159         Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
3160      You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,
3161      if you deny your greefes to your Friend
3162      
3163         Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement
3164      
3165         Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce of
3166      the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
3167        Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is
3168      something musty.
3169      Enter one with a Recorder.
3170      
3171      O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
3172      do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
3173      would driue me into a toyle?
3174        Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
3175      is too vnmannerly
3176      
3177         Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
3178      vpon this Pipe?
3179        Guild. My Lord, I cannot
3180      
3181         Ham. I pray you
3182      
3183         Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot
3184      
3185         Ham. I do beseech you
3186      
3187         Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord
3188      
3189         Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
3190      with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
3191      mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
3192      Looke you, these are the stoppes
3193      
3194         Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtterance
3195      of hermony, I haue not the skill
3196      
3197         Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
3198      you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
3199      seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
3200      of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
3201      Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,
3202      excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
3203      you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
3204      plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
3205      though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God
3206      blesse you Sir.
3207      Enter Polonius.
3208      
3209        Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,
3210      and presently
3211      
3212         Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
3213      like a Camell
3214      
3215         Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed
3216      
3217         Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell
3218      
3219         Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell
3220      
3221         Ham. Or like a Whale?
3222        Polon. Verie like a Whale
3223      
3224         Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
3225      They foole me to the top of my bent.
3226      I will come by and by
3227      
3228         Polon. I will say so.
3229      Enter.
3230      
3231        Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:
3232      'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
3233      When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out
3234      Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
3235      And do such bitter businesse as the day
3236      Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
3237      Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
3238      The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
3239      Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
3240      I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
3241      My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
3242      How in my words someuer she be shent,
3243      To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
3244      Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
3245      
3246        King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
3247      To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
3248      I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
3249      And he to England shall along with you:
3250      The termes of our estate, may not endure
3251      Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
3252      Out of his Lunacies
3253      
3254         Guild. We will our selues prouide:
3255      Most holie and Religious feare it is
3256      To keepe those many many bodies safe
3257      That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie
3258      
3259         Rosin. The single
3260      And peculiar life is bound
3261      With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
3262      To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
3263      That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
3264      The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
3265      Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
3266      What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
3267      Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
3268      To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
3269      Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
3270      Each small annexment, pettie consequence
3271      Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
3272      Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone
3273      
3274         King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
3275      For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
3276      Which now goes too free-footed
3277      
3278         Both. We will haste vs.
3279      
3280      Exeunt. Gent.
3281      
3282      Enter Polonius.
3283      
3284        Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
3285      Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
3286      To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
3287      And as you said, and wisely was it said,
3288      'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
3289      Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare
3290      The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
3291      Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
3292      And tell you what I know
3293      
3294         King. Thankes deere my Lord.
3295      Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
3296      It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
3297      A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
3298      Though inclination be as sharpe as will:
3299      My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
3300      And like a man to double businesse bound,
3301      I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
3302      And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
3303      Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
3304      Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
3305      To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
3306      But to confront the visage of Offence?
3307      And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,
3308      To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
3309      Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
3310      My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
3311      Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
3312      That cannot be, since I am still possest
3313      Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
3314      My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
3315      May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
3316      In the corrupted currants of this world,
3317      Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
3318      And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
3319      Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
3320      There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
3321      In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
3322      Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
3323      To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
3324      Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
3325      Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
3326      Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
3327      Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
3328      Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
3329      Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
3330      Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
3331      All may be well.
3332      Enter Hamlet.
3333      
3334        Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
3335      And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
3336      And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
3337      A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
3338      I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
3339      To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
3340      He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
3341      With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
3342      And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
3343      But in our circumstance and course of thought
3344      'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
3345      To take him in the purging of his Soule,
3346      When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.
3347      Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
3348      When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
3349      Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,
3350      At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
3351      That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
3352      Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
3353      And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
3354      As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
3355      This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.
3356      Enter.
3357      
3358        King. My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
3359      Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.
3360      Enter.
3361      
3362      Enter Queene and Polonius.
3363      
3364        Pol. He will come straight:
3365      Looke you lay home to him,
3366      Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
3367      And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
3368      Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
3369      Pray you be round with him
3370      
3371         Ham. within. Mother, mother, mother
3372      
3373         Qu. Ile warrant you, feare me not.
3374      Withdraw, I heare him coming.
3375      Enter Hamlet.
3376      
3377        Ham. Now Mother, what's the matter?
3378        Qu. Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended
3379      
3380      
3381         Ham. Mother, you haue my Father much offended
3382      
3383         Qu. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue
3384      
3385         Ham. Go, go, you question with an idle tongue
3386      
3387         Qu. Why how now Hamlet?
3388        Ham. Whats the matter now?
3389        Qu. Haue you forgot me?
3390        Ham. No by the Rood, not so:
3391      You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
3392      But would you were not so. You are my Mother
3393      
3394         Qu. Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake
3395      
3396         Ham. Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not
3397      boudge:
3398      You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
3399      Where you may see the inmost part of you?
3400        Qu. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
3401      Helpe, helpe, hoa
3402      
3403         Pol. What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe
3404      
3405         Ham. How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead
3406      
3407         Pol. Oh I am slaine.
3408      
3409      Killes Polonius
3410      
3411         Qu. Oh me, what hast thou done?
3412        Ham. Nay I know not, is it the King?
3413        Qu. Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
3414        Ham. A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
3415      As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother
3416      
3417         Qu. As kill a King?
3418        Ham. I Lady, 'twas my word.
3419      Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
3420      I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
3421      Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
3422      Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
3423      And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
3424      If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
3425      If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
3426      That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense
3427      
3428         Qu. What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
3429      In noise so rude against me?
3430        Ham. Such an Act
3431      That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
3432      Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
3433      From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
3434      And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
3435      As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
3436      As from the body of Contraction pluckes
3437      The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
3438      A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
3439      Yea this solidity and compound masse,
3440      With tristfull visage as against the doome,
3441      Is thought-sicke at the act
3442      
3443         Qu. Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders
3444      in the Index
3445      
3446         Ham. Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
3447      The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
3448      See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
3449      Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
3450      An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
3451      A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
3452      New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:
3453      A Combination, and a forme indeed,
3454      Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
3455      To giue the world assurance of a man.
3456      This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
3457      Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
3458      Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
3459      Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
3460      And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
3461      You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
3462      The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
3463      And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
3464      Would step from this, to this? What diuell was't,
3465      That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
3466      O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,
3467      If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
3468      To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
3469      And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
3470      When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
3471      Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
3472      As Reason panders Will
3473      
3474         Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.
3475      Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
3476      And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
3477      As will not leaue their Tinct
3478      
3479         Ham. Nay, but to liue
3480      In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
3481      Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
3482      Ouer the nasty Stye
3483      
3484         Qu. Oh speake to me, no more,
3485      These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
3486      No more sweet Hamlet
3487      
3488         Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:
3489      A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe
3490      Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
3491      A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
3492      That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
3493      And put it in his Pocket
3494      
3495         Qu. No more.
3496      Enter Ghost.
3497      
3498        Ham. A King of shreds and patches.
3499      Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
3500      You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?
3501        Qu. Alas he's mad
3502      
3503         Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
3504      That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
3505      Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say
3506      
3507         Ghost. Do not forget: this Visitation
3508      Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
3509      But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
3510      O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
3511      Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
3512      Speake to her Hamlet
3513      
3514         Ham. How is it with you Lady?
3515        Qu. Alas, how is't with you?
3516      That you bend your eye on vacancie,
3517      And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
3518      Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
3519      And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
3520      Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
3521      Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
3522      Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
3523      Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
3524        Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
3525      His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
3526      Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
3527      Least with this pitteous action you conuert
3528      My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
3529      Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood
3530      
3531         Qu. To who do you speake this?
3532        Ham. Do you see nothing there?
3533        Qu. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see
3534      
3535         Ham. Nor did you nothing heare?
3536        Qu. No, nothing but our selues
3537      
3538         Ham. Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
3539      My Father in his habite, as he liued,
3540      Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
3541      Enter.
3542      
3543        Qu. This is the very coynage of your Braine,
3544      This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in
3545      
3546         Ham. Extasie?
3547      My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
3548      And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
3549      That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
3550      And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
3551      Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
3552      Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
3553      That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
3554      It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
3555      Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
3556      Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
3557      Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
3558      And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
3559      To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
3560      For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
3561      Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
3562      Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good
3563      
3564         Qu. Oh Hamlet,
3565      Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine
3566      
3567         Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,
3568      And liue the purer with the other halfe.
3569      Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
3570      Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
3571      And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
3572      To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,
3573      And when you are desirous to be blest,
3574      Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
3575      I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
3576      To punish me with this, and this with me,
3577      That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
3578      I will bestow him, and will answer well
3579      The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
3580      I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
3581      Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde
3582      
3583         Qu. What shall I do?
3584        Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
3585      Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
3586      Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
3587      And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
3588      Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
3589      Make you to rauell all this matter out,
3590      That I essentially am not in madnesse,
3591      But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
3592      For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
3593      Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
3594      Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
3595      No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
3596      Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
3597      Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
3598      To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
3599      And breake your owne necke downe
3600      
3601         Qu. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
3602      And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
3603      What thou hast saide to me
3604      
3605         Ham. I must to England, you know that?
3606        Qu. Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on
3607      
3608         Ham. This man shall set me packing:
3609      Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
3610      Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
3611      Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
3612      Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
3613      Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
3614      Good night Mother.
3615      Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.
3616      
3617      Enter King.
3618      
3619        King. There's matters in these sighes.
3620      These profound heaues
3621      You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
3622      Where is your Sonne?
3623        Qu. Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
3624        King. What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?
3625        Qu. Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
3626      Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
3627      Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
3628      He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
3629      And in his brainish apprehension killes
3630      The vnseene good old man
3631      
3632         King. Oh heauy deed:
3633      It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
3634      His Liberty is full of threats to all,
3635      To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
3636      Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
3637      It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
3638      Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
3639      This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
3640      We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
3641      But like the Owner of a foule disease,
3642      To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
3643      Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
3644        Qu. To draw apart the body he hath kild,
3645      O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
3646      Among a Minerall of Mettels base
3647      Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done
3648      
3649         King. Oh Gertrude, come away:
3650      The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
3651      But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
3652      We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
3653      Both countenance, and excuse.
3654      Enter Ros. & Guild.
3655      
3656      Ho Guildenstern:
3657      Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
3658      Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,
3659      And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
3660      Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
3661      Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
3662      Exit Gent.
3663      
3664      Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
3665      To let them know both what we meane to do,
3666      And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
3667      My soule is full of discord and dismay.
3668      
3669      Exeunt.
3670      
3671      Enter Hamlet.
3672      
3673        Ham. Safely stowed
3674      
3675         Gentlemen within. Hamlet, Lord Hamlet
3676      
3677         Ham. What noise? Who cals on Hamlet?
3678      Oh heere they come.
3679      Enter Ros. and Guildensterne.
3680      
3681        Ro. What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
3682        Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne
3683      
3684         Rosin. Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
3685      And beare it to the Chappell
3686      
3687         Ham. Do not beleeue it
3688      
3689         Rosin. Beleeue what?
3690        Ham. That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine
3691      owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication
3692      should be made by the Sonne of a King
3693      
3694         Rosin. Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
3695        Ham. I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
3696      Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
3697      best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in
3698      the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
3699      when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing
3700      you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe
3701      
3702         Rosin. I vnderstand you not my Lord
3703      
3704         Ham. I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
3705      foolish eare
3706      
3707         Rosin. My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,
3708      and go with vs to the King
3709      
3710         Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not
3711      with the body. The King, is a thing-
3712        Guild. A thing my Lord?
3713        Ham. Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
3714      after.
3715      
3716      Exeunt.
3717      
3718      Enter King.
3719      
3720        King. I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
3721      How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
3722      Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
3723      Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
3724      Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
3725      And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
3726      But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
3727      This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
3728      Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
3729      By desperate appliance are releeued,
3730      Or not at all.
3731      Enter Rosincrane.
3732      
3733      How now? What hath befalne?
3734        Rosin. Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
3735      We cannot get from him
3736      
3737         King. But where is he?
3738        Rosin. Without my Lord, guarded to know your
3739      pleasure
3740      
3741         King. Bring him before vs
3742      
3743         Rosin. Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord.
3744      Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne.
3745      
3746        King. Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
3747        Ham. At Supper
3748      
3749         King. At Supper? Where?
3750        Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
3751      conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm
3752      is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
3753      to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,
3754      and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
3755      but to one Table that's the end
3756      
3757         King. What dost thou meane by this?
3758        Ham. Nothing but to shew you how a King may go
3759      a Progresse through the guts of a Begger
3760

3773      Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
3774      For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence

3778      For England
3779      
3780         Ham. For England?
3781        King. I Hamlet
3782      
3783         Ham. Good
3784      
3785         King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes
3786      
3787         Ham. I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
3788      England. Farewell deere Mother
3789      
3790         King. Thy louing Father Hamlet
3791      
3792         Hamlet. My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
3793      wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
3794      for England.
3795      
3796      Exit
3797      
3798        King. Follow him at foote,
3799      Tempt him with speed aboord:
3800      Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
3801      Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
3802      That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.
3803      And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
3804      As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
3805      Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
3806      After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
3807      Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
3808      Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
3809      By Letters coniuring to that effect
3810      The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,
3811      For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
3812      And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
3813      How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.
3814      
3815      Exit
3816      
3817      Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.
3818      
3819        For. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
3820      Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
3821      Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
3822      Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
3823      If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
3824      We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
3825      And let him know so
3826      
3827         Cap. I will doo't, my Lord
3828      
3829         For. Go safely on.
3830      Enter.
3831      
3832      Enter Queene and Horatio.
3833      
3834        Qu. I will not speake with her
3835      
3836         Hor. She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode
3837      will needs be pittied
3838      
3839         Qu. What would she haue?
3840        Hor. She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
3841      There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
3842      Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
3843      That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
3844      Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
3845      The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
3846      And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
3847      Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
3848      Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
3849      Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily
3850      
3851         Qu. 'Twere good she were spoken with,
3852      For she may strew dangerous coniectures
3853      In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
3854      To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)
3855      Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
3856      So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
3857      It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
3858      Enter Ophelia distracted.
3859      
3860        Ophe. Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark
3861      
3862         Qu. How now Ophelia?
3863        Ophe. How should I your true loue know from another one?
3864      By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone
3865      
3866         Qu. Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
3867        Ophe. Say you? Nay pray you marke.
3868      He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,
3869      At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
3870      Enter King.
3871      
3872        Qu. Nay but Ophelia
3873      
3874         Ophe. Pray you marke.
3875      White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow
3876      
3877         Qu. Alas, looke heere my Lord
3878      
3879         Ophe. Larded with sweet Flowers:
3880      Which bewept to the graue did not go,
3881      With true-loue showres
3882      
3883         King. How do ye, pretty Lady?
3884        Ophe. Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
3885      a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
3886      know not what we may be. God be at your Table
3887      
3888         King. Conceit vpon her Father
3889      
3890         Ophe. Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when
3891      they aske you what it meanes, say you this:
3892      To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, all in the morning betime,
3893      And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
3894      Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore,
3895      Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more
3896      
3897         King. Pretty Ophelia
3898      
3899         Ophe. Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont.
3900      By gis, and by S[aint]. Charity,
3901      Alacke, and fie for shame:
3902      Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
3903      By Cocke they are too blame.
3904      Quoth she before you tumbled me,
3905      You promis'd me to Wed:
3906      So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,
3907      And thou hadst not come to my bed
3908      
3909         King. How long hath she bin thus?
3910        Ophe. I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,
3911      but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
3912      lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
3913      and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my
3914      Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
3915      Goodnight, goodnight.
3916      Enter.
3917      
3918        King. Follow her close,
3919      Giue her good watch I pray you:
3920      Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
3921      All from her Fathers death. Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,
3922      When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
3923      But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine,
3924      Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
3925      Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
3926      Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
3927      For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly
3928      In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia
3929      Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
3930      Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
3931      Last, and as much containing as all these,
3932      Her Brother is in secret come from France,
3933      Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
3934      And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
3935      With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
3936      Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
3937      Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
3938      In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this,
3939      Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
3940      Giues me superfluous death.
3941      
3942      A Noise within.
3943      
3944      Enter a Messenger.
3945      
3946        Qu. Alacke, what noyse is this?
3947        King. Where are my Switzers?
3948      Let them guard the doore. What is the matter?
3949        Mes. Saue your selfe, my Lord.
3950      The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List)
3951      Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
3952      Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head,
3953      Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
3954      And as the world were now but to begin,
3955      Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
3956      The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
3957      They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
3958      Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
3959      Laertes shall be King, Laertes King
3960      
3961         Qu. How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
3962      Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.
3963      
3964      Noise within. Enter Laertes.
3965      
3966        King. The doores are broke
3967      
3968         Laer. Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without
3969      
3970         All. No, let's come in
3971      
3972         Laer. I pray you giue me leaue
3973      
3974         Al. We will, we will

3977      Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father
3978      
3979         Qu. Calmely good Laertes
3980      
3981         Laer. That drop of blood, that calmes
3982      Proclaimes me Bastard:
3983      Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
3984      Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
3985      Of my true Mother
3986      
3987         King. What is the cause Laertes,
3988      That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
3989      Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:
3990      There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
3991      That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
3992      Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,
3993      Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude.
3994      Speake man
3995      
3996         Laer. Where's my Father?
3997        King. Dead
3998      
3999         Qu. But not by him
4000      
4001         King. Let him demand his fill
4002      
4003         Laer. How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
4004      To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
4005      Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
4006      I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
4007      That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
4008      Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
4009      Most throughly for my Father
4010      
4011         King. Who shall stay you?
4012        Laer. My Will, not all the world,
4013      And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
4014      They shall go farre with little
4015      
4016         King. Good Laertes:
4017      If you desire to know the certaintie
4018      Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
4019      That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
4020      Winner and Looser
4021      
4022         Laer. None but his Enemies
4023      
4024         King. Will you know them then
4025      
4026         La. To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
4027      And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
4028      Repast them with my blood
4029      
4030         King. Why now you speake
4031      Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
4032      That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
4033      And am most sensible in greefe for it,
4034      It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
4035      As day do's to your eye.
4036      
4037      A noise within. Let her come in.
4038      
4039      Enter Ophelia.
4040      
4041        Laer. How now? what noise is that?
4042      Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
4043      Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
4044      By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
4045      Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May,
4046      Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
4047      Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
4048      Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
4049      Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
4050      It sends some precious instance of it selfe
4051      After the thing it loues
4052      
4053         Ophe. They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
4054      Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
4055      And on his graue raines many a teare,
4056      Fare you well my Doue
4057      
4058         Laer. Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,
4059      it could not moue thus
4060      
4061         Ophe. You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
4062      him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is
4063      the false Steward that stole his masters daughter
4064      
4065         Laer. This nothings more then matter
4066      
4067         Ophe. There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
4068      Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
4069      Thoughts
4070      
4071         Laer. A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance
4072      fitted
4073      
4074         Ophe. There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
4075      Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
4076      Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
4077      with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you
4078      some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
4079      They say, he made a good end;
4080      For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy
4081      
4082         Laer. Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
4083      She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse
4084      
4085         Ophe. And will he not come againe,
4086      And will he not come againe:
4087      No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,
4088      He neuer wil come againe.
4089      His Beard as white as Snow,
4090      All Flaxen was his Pole:
4091      He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
4092      Gramercy on his Soule.
4093      And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
4094      God buy ye.
4095      
4096      Exeunt. Ophelia
4097      
4098        Laer. Do you see this, you Gods?
4099        King. Laertes, I must common with your greefe,
4100      Or you deny me right: go but apart,
4101      Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
4102      And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
4103      If by direct or by Colaterall hand
4104      They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
4105      Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
4106      To you in satisfaction. But if not,
4107      Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
4108      And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
4109      To giue it due content
4110      
4111         Laer. Let this be so:
4112      His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
4113      No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
4114      No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
4115      Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
4116      That I must call in question
4117      
4118         King. So you shall:
4119      And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
4120      I pray you go with me.
4121      
4122      Exeunt.
4123      
4124      Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.
4125      
4126        Hora. What are they that would speake with me?
4127        Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you
4128      
4129         Hor. Let them come in,
4130      I do not know from what part of the world
4131      I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
4132      Enter Saylor.
4133      
4134        Say. God blesse you Sir
4135      
4136         Hor. Let him blesse thee too
4137      
4138         Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter
4139      for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
4140      bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
4141      to know it is.
4142      
4143      Reads the Letter.
4144      
4145      Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these
4146      Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters
4147      for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
4148      Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too
4149      slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I
4150      boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so
4151      I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like
4152      Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe
4153      a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue
4154      sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest
4155      flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee
4156      dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.
4157      These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance
4158      and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them
4159      I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.
4160      He that thou knowest thine,
4161      Hamlet.
4162      Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
4163      And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
4164      To him from whom you brought them.
4165      Enter.
4166      
4167      Enter King and Laertes.
4168      
4169        King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
4170      And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
4171      Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
4172      That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
4173      Pursued my life
4174      
4175         Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,
4176      Why you proceeded not against these feates,
4177      So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
4178      As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
4179      You mainly were stirr'd vp?
4180        King. O for two speciall Reasons,
4181      Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,
4182      And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
4183      Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
4184      My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
4185      She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
4186      That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
4187      I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
4188      Why to a publike count I might not go,
4189      Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
4190      Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
4191      Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
4192      Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
4193      Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
4194      Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
4195      And not where I had arm'd them
4196      
4197         Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
4198      A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
4199      Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
4200      Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
4201      For her perfections. But my reuenge will come
4202      
4203         King. Breake not your sleepes for that,
4204      You must not thinke
4205      That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
4206      That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
4207      And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
4208      I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
4209      And that I hope will teach you to imagine-
4210      Enter a Messenger.
4211      
4212      How now? What Newes?
4213        Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your
4214      Maiesty: this to the Queene
4215      
4216         King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
4217        Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
4218      They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them
4219      
4220         King. Laertes you shall heare them:
4221      Leaue vs.
4222      
4223      Exit Messenger
4224      
4225      High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
4226      Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly
4227      Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount
4228      th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
4229      Hamlet.
4230      What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
4231      Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
4232        Laer. Know you the hand?
4233        Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript
4234      here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
4235        Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
4236      It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
4237      That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
4238      Thus diddest thou
4239      
4240         Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:
4241      How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
4242        Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace
4243      
4244         Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
4245      As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
4246      No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
4247      To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
4248      Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
4249      And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
4250      But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
4251      And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
4252      Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
4253      I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
4254      And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
4255      Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
4256      And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
4257      As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
4258      With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
4259      That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
4260      Come short of what he did
4261      
4262         Laer. A Norman was't?
4263        Kin. A Norman
4264      
4265         Laer. Vpon my life Lamound
4266      
4267         Kin. The very same
4268      
4269         Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
4270      And Iemme of all our Nation
4271      
4272         Kin. Hee mad confession of you,
4273      And gaue you such a Masterly report,
4274      For Art and exercise in your defence;
4275      And for your Rapier most especiall,
4276      That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
4277      If one could match you Sir. This report of his
4278      Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,
4279      That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
4280      Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
4281      Now out of this
4282      
4283         Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?
4284        Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?
4285      Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
4286      A face without a heart?
4287        Laer. Why aske you this?
4288        Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
4289      But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
4290      And that I see in passages of proofe,
4291      Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
4292      Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,
4293      To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
4294      More then in words?
4295        Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church
4296      
4297         Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
4298      Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes
4299      Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
4300      Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:
4301      Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
4302      And set a double varnish on the fame
4303      The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
4304      And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
4305      Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
4306      Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
4307      Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
4308      A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
4309      Requit him for your Father
4310      
4311         Laer. I will doo't.
4312      And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
4313      I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
4314      So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
4315      Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
4316      Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
4317      Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
4318      That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
4319      With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
4320      It may be death
4321      
4322         Kin. Let's further thinke of this,
4323      Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
4324      May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
4325      And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
4326      'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
4327      Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
4328      If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
4329      Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
4330      I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,
4331      As make your bowts more violent to the end,
4332      And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
4333      A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
4334      If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
4335      Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
4336      Enter Queene.
4337      
4338        Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
4339      So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes
4340      
4341         Laer. Drown'd! O where?
4342        Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
4343      That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
4344      There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
4345      Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
4346      That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
4347      But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
4348      There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
4349      Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
4350      When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
4351      Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
4352      And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
4353      Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
4354      As one incapable of her owne distresse,
4355      Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
4356      Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
4357      Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
4358      Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
4359      To muddy death
4360      
4361         Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?
4362        Queen. Drown'd, drown'd
4363      
4364         Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,
4365      And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
4366      It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
4367      Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
4368      The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
4369      I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
4370      But that this folly doubts it.
4371      Enter.
4372      
4373        Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:
4374      How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
4375      Now feare I this will giue it start againe;
4376      Therefore let's follow.
4377      
4378      Exeunt.
4379      
4380      Enter two Clownes.
4381      
4382        Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
4383      wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
4384        Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
4385      straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
4386      buriall
4387      
4388         Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
4389      her owne defence?
4390        Other. Why 'tis found so
4391      
4392         Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
4393      heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues
4394      an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
4395      Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
4396      wittingly
4397      
4398         Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer
4399      
4400         Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
4401      heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
4402      and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
4403      marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne
4404      him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not
4405      guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life
4406      
4407         Other. But is this law?
4408        Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law
4409      
4410         Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not
4411      beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
4412      out of Christian Buriall
4413      
4414         Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that
4415      great folke should haue countenance in this world to
4416      drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
4417      Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
4418      but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp
4419      Adams Profession
4420      
4421         Other. Was he a Gentleman?
4422        Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes
4423      
4424         Other. Why he had none
4425      
4426         Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand
4427      the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;
4428      could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question
4429      to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse
4430      thy selfe-
4431        Other. Go too
4432      
4433         Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the
4434      Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
4435        Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a
4436      thousand Tenants
4437      
4438         Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
4439      does well; but how does it well? it does well to those
4440      that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
4441      built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
4442      may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come
4443      
4444         Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,
4445      or a Carpenter?
4446        Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake
4447      
4448         Other. Marry, now I can tell
4449      
4450         Clo. Too't
4451      
4452         Other. Masse, I cannot tell.
4453      Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.
4454      
4455        Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
4456      dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
4457      you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the
4458      Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
4459      to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.
4460      
4461      Sings.
4462      
4463      In youth when I did loue, did loue,
4464      me thought it was very sweete:
4465      To contract O the time for a my behoue,
4466      O me thought there was nothing meete
4467      
4468         Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that
4469      he sings at Graue-making?
4470        Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse
4471      
4472         Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
4473      the daintier sense
4474      
4475         Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps
4476      hath caught me in his clutch:
4477      And hath shipped me intill the Land,
4478      as if I had neuer beene such
4479      
4480         Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
4481      once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
4482      were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It
4483      might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
4484      one that could circumuent God, might it not?
4485        Hor. It might, my Lord
4486      
4487         Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
4488      sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
4489      might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
4490      a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
4491        Hor. I, my Lord
4492      
4493         Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
4494      Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
4495      Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
4496      see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
4497      to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke
4498      on't
4499      
4500         Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
4501      for and a shrowding-Sheete:
4502      O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
4503      for such a Guest is meete
4504      
4505         Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the
4506      Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his
4507      Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why
4508      doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
4509      the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
4510      his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
4511      time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
4512      his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
4513      Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,
4514      to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his
4515      Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double
4516      ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
4517      Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
4518      hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
4519      haue no more? ha?
4520        Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord
4521      
4522         Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
4523        Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too
4524      
4525         Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
4526      in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
4527      this Sir?
4528        Clo. Mine Sir:
4529      O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
4530      for such a Guest is meete
4531      
4532         Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't
4533      
4534         Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
4535      for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine
4536      
4537         Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
4538      'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
4539      lyest
4540      
4541         Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
4542      to you
4543      
4544         Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?
4545        Clo. For no man Sir
4546      
4547         Ham. What woman then?
4548        Clo. For none neither
4549      
4550         Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
4551        Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,
4552      shee's dead
4553      
4554         Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake
4555      by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
4556      Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
4557      the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
4558      comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
4559      Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
4560        Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
4561      that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras
4562      
4563         Ham. How long is that since?
4564        Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:
4565      It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee
4566      that was mad, and sent into England
4567      
4568         Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?
4569        Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his
4570      wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there
4571      
4572         Ham. Why?
4573        Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
4574      mad as he
4575      
4576         Ham. How came he mad?
4577        Clo. Very strangely they say
4578      
4579         Ham. How strangely?
4580        Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits
4581      
4582         Ham. Vpon what ground?
4583        Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene
4584      heere, man and Boy thirty yeares
4585      
4586         Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
4587        Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
4588      many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
4589      the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
4590      yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare
4591      
4592         Ham. Why he, more then another?
4593        Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
4594      he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,
4595      is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull
4596      now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years
4597      
4598         Ham. Whose was it?
4599        Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
4600      Whose doe you thinke it was?
4601        Ham. Nay, I know not
4602      
4603         Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a
4604      Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull
4605      Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester
4606      
4607         Ham. This?
4608        Clo. E'ene that
4609      
4610         Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
4611      a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
4612      hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
4613      abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere
4614      hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
4615      Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your
4616      Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
4617      set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own
4618      Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies
4619      Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
4620      fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee
4621      Horatio tell me one thing
4622      
4623         Hor. What's that my Lord?
4624        Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
4625      i'th' earth?
4626        Hor. E'ene so
4627      
4628         Ham. And smelt so? Puh
4629      
4630         Hor. E'ene so, my Lord
4631      
4632         Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.
4633      Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
4634      till he find it stopping a bunghole
4635      
4636         Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so
4637      
4638         Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
4639      with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
4640      Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth
4641      into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
4642      Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)
4643      might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
4644      Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
4645      Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
4646      Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
4647      Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
4648      But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
4649      Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.
4650      
4651      The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
4652      And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
4653      The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
4654      Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
4655      Couch we a while, and mark
4656      
4657         Laer. What Cerimony else?
4658        Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke
4659      
4660         Laer. What Cerimony else?
4661        Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
4662      As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,
4663      And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
4664      She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
4665      Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
4666      Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
4667      Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
4668      Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
4669      Of Bell and Buriall
4670      
4671         Laer. Must there no more be done ?
4672        Priest. No more be done:
4673      We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
4674      To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her
4675      As to peace-parted Soules
4676      
4677         Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,
4678      And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
4679      May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)
4680      A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
4681      When thou liest howling?
4682        Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?
4683        Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
4684      I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:
4685      I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)
4686      And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue
4687      
4688         Laer. Oh terrible woer,
4689      Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
4690      Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
4691      Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,
4692      Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:
4693      
4694      Leaps in the graue.
4695      
4696      Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
4697      Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
4698      To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
4699      Of blew Olympus
4700      
4701         Ham. What is he, whose griefes
4702      Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
4703      Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
4704      Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
4705      Hamlet the Dane
4706      
4707         Laer. The deuill take thy soule
4708      
4709         Ham. Thou prai'st not well,
4710      I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
4711      Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
4712      Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
4713      Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand
4714      
4715         King. Pluck them asunder
4716      
4717         Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet
4718      
4719         Gen. Good my Lord be quiet
4720      
4721         Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
4722      Vntill my eielids will no longer wag
4723      
4724         Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
4725        Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers
4726      Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)
4727      Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
4728        King. Oh he is mad Laertes,
4729        Qu. For loue of God forbeare him
4730      
4731         Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.
4732      Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
4733      Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
4734      Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
4735      To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
4736      Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
4737      And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
4738      Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
4739      Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
4740      Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,
4741      Ile rant as well as thou
4742      
4743         Kin. This is meere Madnesse:
4744      And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
4745      Anon as patient as the female Doue,
4746      When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
4747      His silence will sit drooping
4748      
4749         Ham. Heare you Sir:
4750      What is the reason that you vse me thus?
4751      I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:
4752      Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,
4753      The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
4754      Enter.
4755      
4756        Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,
4757      Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,
4758      Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
4759      Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,
4760      This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
4761      An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
4762      Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
4763      
4764      Exeunt.
4765      
4766      Enter Hamlet and Horatio
4767      
4768         Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
4769      You doe remember all the Circumstance
4770      
4771         Hor. Remember it my Lord?
4772        Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
4773      That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
4774      Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
4775      (And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
4776      Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
4777      When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
4778      There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
4779      Rough-hew them how we will
4780      
4781         Hor. That is most certaine
4782      
4783         Ham. Vp from my Cabin
4784      My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,
4785      Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
4786      Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
4787      To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
4788      (My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
4789      Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,
4790      Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
4791      Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
4792      Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
4793      With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
4794      That on the superuize no leasure bated,
4795      No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
4796      My head should be struck off
4797      
4798         Hor. Ist possible?
4799        Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
4800      But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
4801        Hor. I beseech you
4802      
4803         Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
4804      Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
4805      They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
4806      Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
4807      I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
4808      A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
4809      How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
4810      It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know
4811      The effects of what I wrote?
4812        Hor. I, good my Lord
4813      
4814         Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,
4815      As England was his faithfull Tributary,
4816      As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
4817      As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
4818      And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
4819      And many such like Assis of great charge,
4820      That on the view and know of these Contents,
4821      Without debatement further, more or lesse,
4822      He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
4823      Not shriuing time allowed
4824      
4825         Hor. How was this seal'd?
4826        Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
4827      I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
4828      Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
4829      Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
4830      Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
4831      The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
4832      Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
4833      Thou know'st already
4834      
4835         Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't
4836      
4837         Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
4838      They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
4839      Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
4840      'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
4841      Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
4842      Of mighty opposites
4843      
4844         Hor. Why, what a King is this?
4845        Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
4846      He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
4847      Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
4848      Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
4849      And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
4850      To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
4851      To let this Canker of our nature come
4852      In further euill
4853      
4854         Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England
4855      What is the issue of the businesse there
4856      
4857         Ham. It will be short,
4858      The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more
4859      Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,
4860      That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
4861      For by the image of my Cause, I see
4862      The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
4863      But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
4864      Into a Towring passion
4865      
4866         Hor. Peace, who comes heere?
4867      Enter young Osricke.
4868      
4869        Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke
4870      
4871         Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
4872        Hor. No my good Lord
4873      
4874         Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
4875      know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
4876      be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
4877      Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession
4878      of dirt
4879      
4880         Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,
4881      I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty
4882      
4883         Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put
4884      your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head
4885      
4886         Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot
4887      
4888         Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
4889      Northerly
4890      
4891         Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed
4892      
4893         Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
4894      Complexion
4895      
4896         Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
4897      I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie
4898      to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
4899      Sir, this is the matter
4900      
4901         Ham. I beseech you remember
4902      
4903         Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
4904      Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
4905      his weapon
4906      
4907         Ham. What's his weapon?
4908        Osr. Rapier and dagger
4909      
4910         Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well
4911      
4912         Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
4913      against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
4914      Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
4915      Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
4916      deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
4917      carriages, and of very liberall conceit
4918      
4919         Ham. What call you the Carriages?
4920        Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers
4921      
4922         Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
4923      matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
4924      it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses
4925      against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
4926      liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against
4927      the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
4928        Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
4929      you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
4930      He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
4931      imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
4932      Answere
4933      
4934         Ham. How if I answere no?
4935        Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
4936      in tryall
4937      
4938         Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
4939      his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
4940      the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
4941      King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
4942      not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits
4943      
4944         Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
4945        Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature
4946      will
4947      
4948         Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship
4949      
4950         Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it
4951      himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue
4952      
4953         Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
4954      head
4955      
4956         Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
4957      suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
4958      that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
4959      the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
4960      yesty collection, which carries them through & through
4961      the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
4962      them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out
4963      
4964         Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord
4965      
4966         Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
4967      I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
4968      oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about
4969      my heart: but it is no matter
4970      
4971         Hor. Nay, good my Lord
4972      
4973         Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of
4974      gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman
4975      
4976         Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall
4977      their repaire hither, and say you are not fit
4978      
4979         Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
4980      Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
4981      to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
4982      be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
4983      man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?
4984      Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
4985      Foyles,
4986      and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.
4987      
4988        Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
4989      
4990         Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
4991      But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
4992      This presence knowes,
4993      And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht
4994      With sore distraction? What I haue done
4995      That might your nature honour, and exception
4996      Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
4997      Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.
4998      If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
4999      And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
5000      Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
5001      Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
5002      Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
5003      His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
5004      Sir, in this Audience,
5005      Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
5006      Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
5007      That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
5008      And hurt my Mother
5009      
5010         Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,
5011      Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
5012      To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
5013      I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
5014      Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
5015      I haue a voyce, and president of peace
5016      To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
5017      I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
5018      And wil not wrong it
5019      
5020         Ham. I do embrace it freely,
5021      And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
5022      Giue vs the Foyles: Come on
5023      
5024         Laer. Come one for me
5025      
5026         Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
5027      Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
5028      Sticke fiery off indeede
5029      
5030         Laer. You mocke me Sir
5031      
5032         Ham. No by this hand
5033      
5034         King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,
5035      Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager
5036      
5037         Ham. Verie well my Lord,
5038      Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side
5039      
5040         King. I do not feare it,
5041      I haue seene you both:
5042      But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes
5043      
5044         Laer. This is too heauy,
5045      Let me see another
5046      
5047         Ham. This likes me well,
5048      These Foyles haue all a length.
5049      
5050      Prepare to play.
5051      
5052        Osricke. I my good Lord
5053      
5054         King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
5055      If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,
5056      Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
5057      Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
5058      The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
5059      And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
5060      Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
5061      In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
5062      Giue me the Cups,
5063      And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
5064      The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
5065      The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
5066      Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,
5067      And you the Iudges beare a wary eye
5068      
5069         Ham. Come on sir
5070      
5071         Laer. Come on sir.
5072      
5073      They play.
5074      
5075        Ham. One
5076      
5077         Laer. No
5078      
5079         Ham. Iudgement
5080      
5081         Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit
5082      
5083         Laer. Well: againe
5084      
5085         King. Stay, giue me drinke.
5086      Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
5087      Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,
5088      
5089      Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.
5090      
5091        Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
5092      Come: Another hit; what say you?
5093        Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse
5094      
5095         King. Our Sonne shall win
5096      
5097         Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.
5098      Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
5099      The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet
5100      
5101         Ham. Good Madam
5102      
5103         King. Gertrude, do not drinke
5104      
5105         Qu. I will my Lord;
5106      I pray you pardon me
5107      
5108         King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late
5109      
5110         Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,
5111      By and by
5112      
5113         Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face
5114      
5115         Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now
5116      
5117         King. I do not thinke't
5118      
5119         Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience
5120      
5121         Ham. Come for the third.
5122      Laertes, you but dally,
5123      I pray you passe with your best violence,
5124      I am affear'd you make a wanton of me
5125      
5126         Laer. Say you so? Come on.
5127      
5128      Play.
5129      
5130        Osr. Nothing neither way
5131      
5132         Laer. Haue at you now.
5133      
5134      In scuffling they change Rapiers.
5135      
5136        King. Part them, they are incens'd
5137      
5138         Ham. Nay come, againe
5139      
5140         Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa
5141      
5142         Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?
5143        Osr. How is't Laertes?
5144        Laer. Why as a Woodcocke
5145      To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
5146      I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie
5147      
5148         Ham. How does the Queene?
5149        King. She sounds to see them bleede
5150      
5151         Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
5152      Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,
5153      I am poyson'd
5154      
5155         Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
5156      Treacherie, seeke it out
5157      
5158         Laer. It is heere Hamlet.
5159      Hamlet, thou art slaine,
5160      No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
5161      In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
5162      The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
5163      Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
5164      Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
5165      Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
5166      I can no more, the King, the King's too blame
5167      
5168         Ham. The point envenom'd too,
5169      Then venome to thy worke.
5170      
5171      Hurts the King.
5172      
5173        All. Treason, Treason
5174      
5175         King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt
5176      
5177         Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,
5178      Damned Dane,
5179      Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
5180      Follow my Mother.
5181      
5182      King Dyes.
5183      
5184        Laer. He is iustly seru'd.
5185      It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
5186      Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
5187      Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
5188      Nor thine on me.
5189      
5190      Dyes.
5191      
5192        Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
5193      I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,
5194      You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
5195      That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
5196      Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
5197      Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
5198      But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
5199      Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
5200      To the vnsatisfied
5201      
5202         Hor. Neuer beleeue it.
5203      I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
5204      Heere's yet some Liquor left
5205      
5206         Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
5207      Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
5208      Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,
5209      (Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
5210      If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
5211      Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
5212      And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
5213      To tell my Storie.
5214      
5215      March afarre off, and shout within.
5216      
5217      What warlike noyse is this?
5218      Enter Osricke.
5219      
5220        Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland
5221      To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly
5222      
5223         Ham. O I dye Horatio:
5224      The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,
5225      I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
5226      But I do prophesie th' election lights
5227      On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
5228      So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
5229      Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.
5230      
5231      Dyes
5232      
5233        Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:
5234      Goodnight sweet Prince,
5235      And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
5236      Why do's the Drumme come hither?
5237      Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,
5238      and
5239      Attendants.
5240      
5241        Fortin. Where is this sight?
5242        Hor. What is it ye would see;
5243      If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search
5244      
5245         For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
5246      What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
5247      That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
5248      So bloodily hast strooke
5249      
5250         Amb. The sight is dismall,
5251      And our affaires from England come too late,
5252      The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
5253      To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
5254      That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
5255      Where should we haue our thankes?
5256        Hor. Not from his mouth,
5257      Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:
5258      He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
5259      But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
5260      You from the Polake warres, and you from England
5261      Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
5262      High on a stage be placed to the view,
5263      And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
5264      How these things came about. So shall you heare
5265      Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
5266      Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
5267      Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
5268      And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
5269      Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I
5270      Truly deliuer
5271      
5272         For. Let vs hast to heare it,
5273      And call the Noblest to the Audience.
5274      For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
5275      I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
5276      Which are to claime, my vantage doth
5277      Inuite me,
5278        Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
5279      And from his mouth
5280      Whose voyce will draw on more:
5281      But let this same be presently perform'd,
5282      Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
5283      Lest more mischance
5284      On plots, and errors happen
5285      
5286         For. Let foure Captaines
5287      Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,
5288      For he was likely, had he beene put on
5289      To haue prou'd most royally:
5290      And for his passage,
5291      The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
5292      Speake lowdly for him.
5293      Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
5294      Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
5295      Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.
5296      
5297      Exeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot
5298      off.
