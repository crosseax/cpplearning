// Motivation

// Prior to C++11
    // function objects
    // function pointers

    // often write many short functions that control algorithms
    
    // these short functions would be encapsulated in small classes to produce function objects
    
    // many times the classes and functions are far removed from where they are used 
    // leading to modification, maintenance, and testing issues

    // compiler cannot effectively inline these functions for efficiency
